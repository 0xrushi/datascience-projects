# Implement Uplift Decision Tree with DeltaDeltaP split

To measure uplift we calculate the difference between average of the target variable in
treatment and control groups (M). The best split maximizes the difference between uplift
measure on the left and right. difference(M_left, M_right)

Hot to grow a tree:

1. Create root with all values

2. Recursively run function Build:

```
Build(node):
    If node is at max depth, stop.
    For feature in all features:
        For value in threshold values:
        make_split(feature, value) -> data_left, data_right
        If number of values in a split is lower than the parameter value
        Continue (do not consider this split)
        Calculate delte_delta_p
        Select the best split
        Create node_left, node_right
        Build(node_left)
        Build(node_right)
```

Please note that model construction and predictions are deterministic.

You will need to implement class UpliftTreeRegressor that must have 3 methods:

```
def __init__(
    self,
    Max_depth: int =3, # max tree depth
    Min_samples_leaf: int = 1000, # min number of values in leaf
    Min_samples_leaf_treated: int = 300, # min number of treatment values in leaf
    Min_samples_leaf_control: int = 300, # min number of control values in leaf)
    :
    # do something
    def fit(
    self,
    X: np.ndarray, # (n * k) array with features
    Treatment: np.ndarray, # (n) array with treatment flag
    Y: np.ndarray # (n) array with the target
    ) -> None:
    # fit the model
    def predict(self, X: np.ndarray) -> Iterable(float):
    # compute predictions
    return predictions
```

IMPORTANT:

Threshold algorithm:

```
# column_values - 1d array with the feature values in current node
# threshold_options - threshold values to go over to find the best one
import numpy as np
unique_values = np.unique(column_values)
If len(unique_values) >10:
percentiles = np.percentile(column_values, [3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 80, 90,
95, 97])
else:
percentiles = np.percentile(unique_values, [10, 50, 90])
threshold_options = np.unique(percentiles)
If f <= threshold, then values is on the left, on the right otherwise.
```

**Submission**:
1. Create submission.py and upload it to your github
2. Reply with the link to your solution by June 29, 11:59PM Pacific Day Time
3. Earlier submissions have higher chance of consideration
4. Late submissions are ok, but we can't promise they will be reviewed.
5. Criterias: results accuracy & code quality.#
