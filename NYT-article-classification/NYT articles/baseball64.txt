The deal will be for two years, according to ESPN.May, 31, had a 3.86 earned run average in 24 games for the Twins last season, with 38 strikeouts in 23 ⅓ innings. Since returning from Tommy John surgery in 2018, he is one of only 10 active pitchers with at least 100 relief appearances, an E.R.A. below 3.20 and at least 12 strikeouts per nine innings.A starter throughout the minors and early in his major league career, May has more pitches than the typical reliever. He abandoned his curveball last season, using fewer fastballs, more changeups and twice as many sliders as before. The combination helped him fan 14.7 hitters per nine innings, the best figure of his six seasons with the Twins.May has also cultivated a wide following outside baseball as a streamer for Luminosity, with 178,000 followers on Twitch. He also hosts a podcast and founded a company in Seattle that sells artwork inspired by the gaming world.In May — who worked with the pitching coach Jeremy Hefner before the Mets hired him from Minnesota last year — the Mets add another power arm to a deep group of right-handed relievers that also includes Dellin Betances, Edwin Diaz, Jeurys Familia, Seth Lugo, Brad Brach and Jacob Barnes, who was claimed off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels last month.Under their new owner, Steven A. Cohen, the Mets plan to be aggressive in free agency, which is off to a typically sluggish start. A new wave of free agents will hit the market on Wednesday night, the deadline for teams to offer contracts to players eligible for salary arbitration.
