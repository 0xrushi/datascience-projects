The slugging outfielder was a rock of consistency for 23 seasons. He was a superstar unlike any before him — or any since.Credit...T. Michael KezaSupported byBy The New York TimesHank Aaron wasn’t as loud as some other stars, on or off the field. He was a steady presence, a fixture in right field, a mainstay at the All-Star Game and a terror at the plate. His path was often difficult, and his name is sometimes overlooked when rattling off the greatest to ever play the game. But make no mistake: To his peers — or the closest thing baseball could offer in terms of peers — Aaron was nothing short of a god among men.There were many special seasons in Aaron’s career, but nothing could quite match 1957, when he blossomed into one of the game’s best players and led the Milwaukee Braves to a World Series title — the franchise’s first championship since 1914 and the only one while the team was based in Milwaukee. Aaron received the Most Valuable Player Award after the season.Aaron never won another M.V.P. Award and his team never won another World Series, but he quietly continued to excel, slowly chipping away at several career batting records that had been considered unbreakable.
