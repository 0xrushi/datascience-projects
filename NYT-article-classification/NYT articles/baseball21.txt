Realmuto the largest contract given to a free agent catcher. The two sides agreed on Tuesday to a five-year, $115.5 million deal, topping the previous record for highest annual pay for a catcher — $23 million, set by Joe Mauer in 2011 — by $100,000 a year.The deal was confirmed by a person familiar with Realmuto’s contract who was not authorized to comment publicly because it was pending a physical examination. The deal was first reported by Craig Mish.All winter, the Phillies, who disappointed in 2020 despite having a talented roster, were seen as the favorite to retain Realmuto, the clear-cut best catcher in baseball.Realmuto, who will turn 30 in March, is a two-time All-Star, two-time Silver Slugger, one-time Gold Glove Award winner, and a rare dual threat at catcher, known for his standout athleticism.During his All-Star campaigns with the Miami Marlins in 2018 and the Phillies in 2019, Realmuto hit .276 with an .822 on-base-plus-slugging percentage and averaged 23 home runs a season. During the pandemic shortened 60-game 2020 season, he hit .266 with an .840 O.P.S. and 11 home runs. Although he plays a physically demanding position where players’ skills decline rapidly, Realmuto has regularly ranked among the best defenders and fastest runners among catchers in recent years.Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants ($167 million over nine years) and the former Minnesota Twin Mauer ($184 million over eight years) — both of whom won Most Valuable Player Awards in their careers — both signed deals larger than Realmuto’s contract, but those were extensions. Realmuto topped catcher Brian McCann, who signed a five year, $85-million contract as a free agent with the Yankees in 2013.
