Stocks jump, with Buffett helping Apple to new highs
NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks made up for a shaky week with a strong finish Friday as Apple led a rally in technology companies. The tech giant hit an all-time high after Warren Buffett said he'd made another big investment. Stocks got off to a mixed start after trade talks between the U.S. and China ended with few signs of progress. The April jobs report showed that hiring continued at a solid clip and wages continued to grow at a slow pace. Apple surged after Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares during the first quarter.
