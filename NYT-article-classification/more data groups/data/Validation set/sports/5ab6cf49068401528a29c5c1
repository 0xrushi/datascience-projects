Greg Bird Removed From the Yankees’ Lineup With a Sore Right Foot
TAMPA, Fla. — Yankees first baseman Greg Bird, who has missed most of the last two seasons with injuries, was scratched from an exhibition game on Saturday and examined for discomfort in his right foot.
Bird left the stadium in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., near Orlando, and returned here to Steinbrenner Field, where he was examined by Daniel Murphy, an orthopedic specialist, before leaving to have magnetic resonance imaging and CT scans on his foot. The tests revealed inflammation in the foot, the team announced Saturday night, and Bird will be evaluated Monday in New York by Martin O’Malley, a foot specialist.
It was unclear what was causing Bird’s discomfort or whether it was related to the surgery he had to remove a bone from the same ankle last July. Bird, who was batting .154 with one home run this spring, told General Manager Brian Cashman that he did not foul a ball off his foot and that some intermittent discomfort started to get worse in Friday’s game.
If Bird is not ready to start the season opener on Thursday in Toronto, the Yankees will turn first base over to Tyler Austin, who has hit .270 with four home runs this spring, and to the recently signed second baseman Neil Walker.
“I’m worried about it, to be honest,” Cashman said. “I’m not sure what we’re dealing with, but when Greg, when he can’t tee it up, it’s a problem for us because he’s a vital member of our organization.”
First base has been a sore spot for the Yankees since late in the 2015 season when Mark Teixeira fouled a ball off his shin and had a strong season cut short. In the last two seasons, the team has started 14 players at the position.
Bird, who missed 2016 because of shoulder surgery, looked primed for a strong return last spring, hitting .451 with eight home runs. But in the final exhibition game, he fouled a ball off his ankle. The injury was initially diagnosed as a bruise, but after a horrible start to the season — he hit .100 (6 for 60) with one home run over the first month —Bird was placed on the disabled list on May 2.
When the injury continued to bother Bird, doctors re-examined him and discovered that he had indeed broken a bone, which they surgically removed in July. He returned in late August, found his form in September and became one of the Yankees’ most consistent hitters in October. His solo home run off Cleveland relief pitcher Andrew Miller helped the Yankees stay alive with a 1-0 win in Game 3 of the division series.
INSIDE PITCH
Jonathan Holder was tabbed for the final spot on the 13-man pitching staff, ahead of Domingo German, in part because the Yankees want German to stretch out in the minor leagues so that he is an option against Minnesota on April 24, when the team plans to use a sixth starter. … Third baseman Brandon Drury, who was hit by a pitch on his left elbow on Friday, is likely to be in the lineup in Monday’s exhibition game in Atlanta, but he will wear an elbow guard.
