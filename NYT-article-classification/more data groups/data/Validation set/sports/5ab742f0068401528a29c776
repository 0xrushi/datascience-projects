Stephen Curry and Kyrie Irving Are Sidelined by Knee Problems
The N.B.A. playoffs start in three weeks. Whether Boston’s Kyrie Irving and Golden State’s Stephen Curry will be ready when the postseason starts seems doubtful.
The Celtics said that Irving would need three to six weeks to recover from a procedure performed on Saturday to relieve irritation on his left knee, that news coming almost simultaneously with word that Curry has a sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his left knee. The Warriors said Curry, who was hurt when his teammate JaVale McGee fell awkwardly into him during a victory on Friday night, would be evaluated again in three weeks.
Based on those timetables, it would appear that both the Celtics and the Warriors will not only be without their All-Star point guards for the rest of the regular season, but very easily could still be without them for when their first-round playoff matchups begin on April 14 or 15.
In the short term, it would seem that being without Irving or Curry for the final games of the regular season will not have a pronounced effect on either club. Boston is fairly well locked into the No. 2 spot in the Eastern Conference playoffs, trailing East-leading Toronto by 4½ games but leading Cleveland by six. Golden State, four games behind first-place Houston in the Western Conference and 10 ahead of third-place Portland, will almost certainly finish No. 2 in the West.
“It could be a lot worse,” Warriors Coach Steve Kerr told reporters just before Curry’s M.R.I. results were revealed. “You think about some of the other guys in the league that have suffered injuries this year. Gordon Hayward is the first one that comes to mind. This is not a major injury. The timing’s not ideal, but we can overcome this. Steph can be back this year.”
“Just got to hold down the fort,” Kerr added, “and understand this is all part of the journey.”
If Irving needs six weeks, that would mean the Celtics — a team that has been dealing with injuries since the first quarter of the first game of the season, when Hayward was lost for the year — would need to get through the entire first round without their best player. Irving’s procedure was to remove a wire in his surgically repaired kneecap, since that wire was irritating a tendon and apparently causing soreness.
“It’s tough when you lose anybody, especially multiple guys,” the Boston rookie Jayson Tatum told Celtics.com. “We’re just going to have to try to figure it out and figure out how to win games.”
Besides Hayward and Irving, the Celtics have been without the rotation players Jaylen Brown, who may return on Sunday; Marcus Smart, who is expected to return next month; and Daniel Theis, who will miss the rest of the season.
The Warriors have also been dealing with multiple injuries. Curry had ankle problems before the knee injury, and the reigning champions have also been playing of late without the All-Stars Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Green is expected to return on Sunday, and Durant’s return is likely this week. Thompson should play again before the end of the regular season.
And the Warriors have been through this drill before, including last season when Durant sustained an M.C.L. sprain — the same injury Curry is now dealing with.
Durant came back in plenty of time for the playoffs, and the Warriors went 16-1 in the postseason on the way to their second title in three seasons. But he needed about five weeks to get right, and if Curry needs that long, the Warriors could be without the two-time winner of the Most Valuable Player Award in the opening round.
“Some years everything goes great,” Kerr said. “Some years they don’t.”
