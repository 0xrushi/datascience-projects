Neymar Will Have Surgery on Fractured Foot
PARIS — Neymar will have surgery in Brazil on his fractured foot, ruling him out of Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League match next week against Real Madrid.
A day after P.S.G. Coach Unai Emery denied reports that Neymar, a star for the Brazilian national team, would have an operation, the club walked back that statement on Wednesday and announced that he would have surgery.
“After an initial treatment period of three days in line with a strict medical protocol, a joint decision has been taken between the medical staffs of both Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team,” P.S.G. said in a statement.
P.S.G. broke soccer’s transfer record last year by paying Barcelona 222 million euros ($260 million) to buy Neymar, in part with the hope that he would lead the club to the Champions League title. But those hopes took a massive blow when he was injured on Sunday during P.S.G.’s 3-0 win over Marseille. Tests later revealed he had a cracked fifth metatarsal in his right foot along with an ankle injury.
P.S.G., the runaway French league leaders, said that “in accordance with the player, it has been decided that Neymar Jr. will undergo surgery in Brazil at the end of this week. He will be operated on by Dr. Rodrigo Lasmar, accompanied by Professor Saillant, representing PSG.”
Gerard Saillant has operated on high-profile athletes, including the former Brazil striker Ronaldo.
After Emery said on Tuesday that Neymar had a chance to recover in time to play at the Parc des Princes against Madrid, the player’s father, Neymar Santos, had cast a doubt on whether his son would participate in the match, saying he believed Neymar would need surgery. There were concerns that Neymar could aggravate the injury and potentially threaten his chances of playing in the World Cup this summer if he continued playing for P.S.G. instead of having surgery.
Metatarsal injuries are common in soccer and can sometimes lead to a lengthy absence. P.S.G., which beat Marseille by 3-0 in a French Cup match on Wednesday without their star striker, did not say how long Neymar would be sidelined, but his father estimated that the recovery would take “between six and eight weeks.”
