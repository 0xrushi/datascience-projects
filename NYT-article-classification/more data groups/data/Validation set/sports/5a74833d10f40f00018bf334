Victims’ Father Lunges at Larry Nassar in Court
A father of two young women who gave victim impact statements at the sentencing hearing of Lawrence G. Nassar was tackled by law enforcement officials when he rushed at the former sports medicine doctor across a courtroom on Friday.
The man, Randall Margraves, had been standing next to his daughters Lauren and Madison in Eaton County Circuit Court in Charlotte, Mich., as they gave statements about Dr. Nassar’s sexual abuse. When they were finished, he asked Judge Janice K. Cunningham if she would give him “five minutes in a locked room” with Dr. Nassar. When she said no, he asked for one minute.
As she was speaking, saying that he knew she could not do that, Mr. Margraves then rushed across the room toward Dr. Nassar, who was seated at a table on his left toward the front of the courtroom. Law enforcement officials wrestled Mr. Margraves down to the ground, handcuffed him and led him out.
“What if this happened to you guys,” he told the deputies handcuffing him.
It was not clear whether Dr. Nassar was injured.
The hearing resumed several minutes later.
“I can’t imagine what it is like for a parent,” the judge said as the hearing resumed after Mr. Margraves was led out. In addition to the Eaton County hearing, another of his daughters, Morgan, had provided a victim impact statement about Dr. Nassar’s abuse at an Ingham County Circuit Court hearing, which ended last week.
Judge Cunningham said Dr. Nassar’s sentence would consume his natural life. “We cannot react by using physical violence and assault against someone who is and has performed criminal acts. That is not how our system works.”
“Let’s get back to the business of why we are here,” she said.
Dr. Nassar sat with his head down, listening.
After he was removed from the courtroom, Mr. Margraves was placed in detention for possible contempt of court, but the judge later released him without charge, Jerri Nesbitt, the executive assistant of Eaton County Sheriff Thomas Reich, said by telephone.
Calls to several members of Mr. Margraves’s family were not returned on Friday.
The hearing is based on a guilty plea by Dr. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports medicine doctor, in November to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13, according to the plea deal.
Earlier, the judge had addressed statements this week by Shannon Smith, a lawyer for Dr. Nassar. Ms. Smith told radio station WWJ that she had a “very hard time” believing that Dr. Nassar could have assaulted more than 250 victims,” The Associated Press reported. She said it’s “really unfortunate” if some girls stepped forward only because of all the attention in the last few weeks, the report said.
Judge Cunningham said before Friday’s hearing started that she met with the lawyers on his team to address the remarks.
“He has disavowed those statements,” she said, adding they were not relevant to the sentencing hearing.
What is relevant, she added, is for the court to hear each individual story and how his actions affected their lives.
The plea agreement said the abuse occurred between September 2009 and September 2011. A sentencing memorandum said the abuse had taken place at Twistars Gymnastics Club, near Lansing, Mich., whose owner and coach, John Geddert, rose to prominence as an Olympics coach in 2012.
More than 65 young women and teenagers were scheduled to give victim impact statements during the sentencing hearing, which started on Wednesday and resumed on Friday, after a one-day break. Judge Cunningham said the number of victims who had come forward was up to 265, some of whom chose to remain anonymous.
About 30 have shared statements as of Friday morning, and Dr. Nassar will be sentenced after all the victims speak. The plea agreement states the minimum sentencing range would be 25 to 40 years for each of the counts.
Last week, more than 150 young women and teenagers publicly confronted Dr. Nassar during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault.
Many of the young women and teenagers who spoke in the two courtrooms have told stories that have similar elements, including their abuse by a doctor they were referred to or instructed to see by coaches. Some said that nothing was done after they finally did come forward to report multiple incidents of the abuse, which stretches back decades.
The United States Olympic Committee said on Friday it had hired a law firm, Ropes & Gray, to determine when U.S.A. Gymnastics or the U.S.O.C. officials first became aware of any evidence of Nassar’s abuse, what that evidence was and what they did with it.
On Friday, Valeri Liukin, the coordinator of the U.S. women’s gymnastics team, said he had resigned, citing the stress of the job. His daughter, Nastia Liukin, won a gold medal for the team in 2008.
“I was truly looking forward to trying to turn this program around and bring success to our country and the gymnastics community,” he said in a statement. “But the present climate causes me, and more importantly my family, far too much stress, difficulty and uncertainty.”
M.S.U. is also under investigation by the N.C.A.A. and the state attorney general.
On Thursday, the Meridian Township, Mich., police chief, Dave Hall, apologized to a young woman, Brianne Randall-Gay, for not seeking an outside opinion when she reported sexual abuse in 2004 by Dr. Nassar, who then defended himself to the police by presenting a stack of medical documents during the investigation.
Ms. Randall-Gay was 17 at the time that she sought Dr. Nassar’s help for her back.
Chief Hall, speaking in a news conference said that Ms. Randall-Gay would help with training and community outreach to help youth understand how to report criminal sexual conduct to the authorities.
“I was disappointed there were no charges filed,” Ms. Randall-Gay said, referring to the decision by the police to not pursue the investigation further after she first reported the abuse. “I felt like I was ignored.”
Dr. Nassar was not charged with sexual abuse of multiple athletes until 2016, after an investigation by The Indianapolis Star brought many of the accusations to light.
He has also been sentenced to between 40 to 175 years in the Ingham County case, and sentences of 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography.
