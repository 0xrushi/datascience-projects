Giants Trade Jason Pierre-Paul to Tampa Bay
The splashy, often prolific and ultimately perplexing Jason Pierre-Paul era in Giants football came to an end Thursday when he was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a third-round choice in next month’s N.F.L. draft.
The teams also exchanged fourth-round selections, and most notably, the Giants unloaded Pierre-Paul’s weighty contract that extended until 2020.
The exit of Pierre-Paul, a defensive end who was once a Giants linchpin but also the star of a peculiar saga over a finger he injured in a firecracker accident, is yet another intrepid move by Dave Gettleman, the team’s new general manager. He is simultaneously rebuilding the franchise and dismantling the roster of his predecessor, Jerry Reese, who was fired late last year.
It was Reese who put his trust in Pierre-Paul with a four-year, $62 million contract just 12 months ago. But he played indifferently last season, leading Gettleman to trade him.
The departure of Pierre-Paul, a first-round draft pick by Reese in 2010, means none of the 45 players Reese selected from 2008 to 2013 remain on the Giants roster.
But for the Giants and their fans, Pierre-Paul, 29, was never just another player.
He arrived eight years ago as an intriguing if risky draft pick and blossomed into a vital, productive cog of the last Giants Super Bowl championship team in 2011. He was twice named to the Pro Bowl and his jersey became among the team’s best-selling apparel items.
But back injuries robbed Pierre-Paul of two years in his prime, and though he rallied for another fruitful season in 2014, he then had a gruesome setback when he lost his right index finger and parts of his right thumb and middle finger in a Fourth of July fireworks incident before the 2015 season.
A peculiar standoff ensued when Pierre-Paul declined to speak with Giants coaches, owners, doctors and team executives about the extent of his hand injuries. At times, team officials could not even explain Pierre-Paul’s whereabouts and his condition was a mystery that created widespread intrigue throughout the summer of 2015, a situation exacerbated by his refusal to attend the team’s training camp.
Pierre-Paul finally returned to the team in November and played with a wrapping on his battered hand that looked like an oven mitt.
His play was uneven, but he came back in the next season to register seven sacks, although he also missed the final four games with a cryptic lower body injury.
Signed to a new contract last season, Pierre-Paul was expected to be a key defensive component. Inexplicably, he was instead not a factor in the team’s most pivotal games and he no longer drew the routine double-coverage that he had in his first five years in the N.F.L. He was credited with 8.5 sacks but each of those sacks came against a lesser team that did not make the playoffs.
With the Giants changing defensive schemes under a new coach, Pat Shurmur, Pierre-Paul’s role might have been diminished had he remained with the team. His trade to Tampa Bay will save the Giants $2.5 million against their salary cap this season and they will no longer be responsible for $37 million of additional salary in 2019-20.
The trade also may mean that the Giants are considering selecting a top-rated pass rusher, like Bradley Chubb of North Carolina State, with the second overall pick they hold in the upcoming N.F.L. draft. The Giants are also weighing several college quarterbacks. Eli Manning, who with Pierre-Paul’s departure is the only starter remaining from the last Giants Super Bowl winning team, turned 37 last month.
As a Giant, Pierre-Paul had 433 combined tackles, 58.5 sacks, and forced 13 fumbles.
