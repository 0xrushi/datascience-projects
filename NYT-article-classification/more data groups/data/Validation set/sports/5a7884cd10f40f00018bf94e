Larry Nassar Is Sentenced to Another 40 to 125 Years in Prison
Lawrence G. Nassar, the former U.S.A. Gymnastics and Michigan State University sports medicine doctor, was sentenced in a Michigan court on Monday to 40 to 125 years in prison for criminal sexual conduct toward girls at a gymnastics facility.
Judge Janice K. Cunningham announced the sentence in Eaton County Circuit Court in Charlotte, Mich., at the end of a sentencing hearing in which more than 60 young women and teenagers read or presented victim impact statements.
The sentence was based on Dr. Nassar’s November guilty plea to three counts of criminal sexual conduct, two of them against girls between the ages of 13 and 15, and one against a girl younger than 13. The abuse took place at Twistars Gymnastics Club, outside Lansing, Mich., between September 2009 and September 2011, the plea agreement said.
The gym was supposed to catapult young female athletes to fruitful careers under the guidance of John Geddert, who owned the gym and coached there. Mr. Geddert coached the U.S. Olympic team in 2012.
Judge Cunningham said the depth and tragedy of the case was incomprehensible. “It spans the country, and the world,” she said. “It has impacted women, children and families of varying ages, races and walks of life. Individuals that have suffered physical and emotional harm as a result of your actions live all over the country and the world.”
Dr. Nassar, in a final statement, said that he was sorry, and that the words of the young women and parents “impacted me to my innermost core.” But he added that he knew “it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all feel.”
The sentencing in Eaton County marked the end of weeks of emotional statements by young women and girls who said they were abused by Dr. Nassar under the guise of medical treatment. Judge Cunningham said on the first day of the hearing that the number of victims who had come forward had risen to 265, some of whom have chosen to remain anonymous.
Last month, more than 150 of them publicly confronted him during a seven-day hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court in Lansing, where he had pleaded guilty in November to seven counts of sexual assault. Among them were Olympic athletes including Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber.
He was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for the charges in Ingham County, and 60 years for a conviction related to child pornography in a separate federal case.
The Eaton County sentence will be served concurrently with the Ingham County sentence but after the child pornography sentence, the judge said.
The abuse came to light after an Indianapolis Star investigation in 2016 reported accusations against Dr. Nassar that went back decades. The case has reverberated far beyond the courtrooms of Michigan, leading to efforts to identify the officials who knew about the abuse and covered it up.
The New York Times identified at least 40 girls and women who say that Dr. Nassar molested them between July 2015, when he fell under F.B.I. scrutiny, and September 2016, when he was exposed by the Indianapolis Star investigation.
U.S.A. Gymnastics, the sport’s governing body, has been widely derided for its handling of the scandal. Last month, its entire board of directors stepped down after the United States Olympic Committee threatened it with decertification.
The case has also prompted a shake-up within M.S.U., Dr. Nassar’s former employer. Its longtime president, Lou Anna Simon, resigned last month, and the board of trustees voted unanimously to name John Engler, the former governor of Michigan, as its interim president. But Mr. Engler’s appointment was met with student protests, and the trustees are facing a possible no-confidence vote by the faculty, the Lansing State Journal reported.
Rachael Denhollander, who filed a police report in August 2016 accusing Dr. Nassar of sexually abusing her when she was 15 years old and became the first woman to be named publicly in the case, described the case on Monday as “the greatest sexual assault scandal in history,” according to a report by The Associated Press.
The victims, she added, “wouldn’t be here had the adults and authorities done what they should have done 20 years ago.”
