In Austria, Police Raids Stemming From Russian Sports Corruption Inquiries
The authorities in Austria raided the headquarters of biathlon’s global governing body following a tip from the World Anti-Doping Agency that its leaders may have been involved with the vast Russian doping scandal that continues to roil international sports.
The Salzburg-based International Biathlon Union, which has long had close links to Russian sports, confirmed the investigation in a news release on Wednesday, in which it also announced that its longtime secretary general, Nicole Resch, had requested a leave of absence. The I.B.U. said the investigation focused on Resch — who had publicly questioned sports regulators’ conclusions about Russia’s systematic cheating — and the group’s president, Anders Besseberg, a former biathlete and cross-country skier who is also a board member of the antidoping agency.
The raid escalates the Russian doping scandal at a time when sports officials have tried to put it in the rearview mirror. Investigators have established that huge amounts of corruption within Russia’s system tainted track and field. The raid in Austria signals that the investigation has extended to other sports’ governing bodies and could raise additional questions about possible bribery in other federations.
Biathlon had been at the center of a number of allegations related to Russian doping years before the 2016 revelations of a state-sponsored scheme that corrupted dozens of sporting events, including to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
The raid on the biathlon organization came after the antidoping agency gave details gleaned by its own investigation team to law enforcement officials in Norway — where a raid also took place — and Austria, as well as the global police organization Interpol. The government investigation began in 2017 and resulted in surveillance of potential targets late last year, according to three people familiar with the case.
“WADA confirms that the issue is linked to doping but as the police investigation is ongoing, the agency can make no further comment at this stage,” the organization said in a statement.
The Norwegian broadcaster NRK, citing a news release from the country’s financial crimes investigator, reported that the police there were providing assistance to Austrian authorities who suspected Norwegians “of economic crime.”
Besseberg, 72, is from Norway, and is one of the longest-serving sports federation presidents. He did not respond to requests for comment.
Late last year, after the International Olympic Committee had banned the Russian Federation from the 2018 Winter Olympics, Besseberg announced that Russia’s biathlon organization had been relegated to “provisional membership” — a largely symbolic suspension that did not limit Russia’s ability to host events. That prompted an outcry from some sports officials and boycotts of competitions in Russia by American and Canadian biathletes.
This week’s raid came as another prominent Norwegian sports figure — Linda Helleland, the nation’s minister of children and equality, who also serves as the vice president of the antidoping agency — proposed an overhaul of global sport’s antidoping system in the wake of the Russian doping scandal.
“Why has it been so difficult to secure universal acceptance of the facts?” Helleland wrote in a proposal circulated privately among WADA executives and obtained by The New York Times. Her analysis of the scandal is expected to be discussed at the organization’s foundation board meeting next month. “How can we avoid the confusion that arose when Russian athletes were treated differently from sport to sport and sometimes within one sport?”
In an interview in Austria in December, Besseberg called the rash of Russian doping violations damaging and said that in reviewing suspicious cases, he had considered each athlete’s circumstances individually.
“We are handling cases and taking our decisions,” he said. “WADA can appeal if they don’t agree with our decisions.”
The full scope of the Russian doping program was revealed by Grigory Rodchenkov, a former director of the country’s antidoping laboratory. Rodchenkov, who is in hiding in the United States, provided details of abuses in biathlon, according to his lawyer, Jim Walden.
“Dr. Rodchenkov has been cooperating with the investigation of the International Biathlon Union, and with other investigations,” Walden said in a statement. “We are hopeful that all doping fraud and corruption in international sports is fully exposed, and we will continue to work diligently to make that a reality.”
In an interview published earlier Wednesday, Rodchenkov told NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster, that biathlon officials had ignored suspicious blood passport results registered by Russian biathletes. Instead of investigating the anomalies, officials simply sent the information to Russia’s antidoping agency, which was itself at the center of the cheating scheme.
“Russia received sensitive information from I.B.U., with a message to take care of it,” Rodchenkov said, according to NRK. Rodchenkov’s claims of a sophisticated scheme to replace drug-tainted samples with clean ones was validated by three separate independent investigations.
Doping by Russian athletes infected biathlon for years, and even after the wider doping program was unmasked, the I.B.U. faced repeated criticism from many of its own members for what they perceived to be weak antidoping policies, and a soft stance toward Russia. That prompted teams from the United States, Ukraine and the Czech Republic to withdraw from last month’s season-ending event in the Russian resort Tyumen.
In 2011 Jacques Rogge, then the I.O.C. president, was so concerned about Russia’s biathlon federation that he urged the country’s president at the time, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to take stronger action. Rodchenkov said in a sworn statement that the billionaire owner of the Nets, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, played a role in obscuring the scheme when he led the Russian Biathlon Union. Prokhorov, who denies the claim, is helping to finance a New York defamation suit against Rodchenkov by three banned biathletes.
In investigating corruption related to Russian sports doping, the Austrian and Norwegian authorities have joined French and American officials, who have conducted their own inquiries dating back several years. While French authorities initially centered their attention on track and field officials, they later broadened their scrutiny of other sports.
