What is happening here? Christina Aguilera, possessor of one of the great voices of the 2000s, has been mostly silent the last five years. And with her new single “Accelerate” — from the forthcoming album “Liberation,” due in June — she’s something not far from silent, one small piece in a fantastically weird puzzle. “Accelerate,” produced by Kanye West, Che Pope and Mike Dean, sounds like it’s built from spare parts: Ty Dolla Sign’s moans and yelps, sinuous keyboard lines, a charmingly staccato verse from 2 Chainz. Somewhere in there is Ms. Aguilera, under-singing and trying not to get pushed into a corner. And yet despite these disparate inputs, there’s something loose and admirable happening here: Everyone is trying new things, and the disarray verges on flamboyance. JON CARAMANICA
“Break-Thru” is the first glimpse of the Dirty Projectors album due in July, “Lamp Lit Prose,” and with it the group’s songwriter, David Longstreth, leaves behind the sullen, disjointed breakup songs from the previous Dirty Projectors album. A perky Afropop guitar lick and a buzzy synthesizer hop and cackle around him as he praises a new love in happy staccato bursts: “She is an epiphany/her electricity.” JON PARELES
The 14-year-old virtuoso Joey Alexander is already on his fourth solo album, and “Eclipse,” out Friday, is his most engrossing yet. Recorded on the day of the solar eclipse in 2017, it finds the pianist sounding uninhibited, letting some sweat fly. As always, his harmonies are a great marvel, and these pieces tend to have an exuberant bounce — carried off with the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Eric Harland — somewhere between swing rhythm, calypso and Javanese propulsion. Six of “Eclipse’s” 11 tracks are originals; “Fourteen” is a highlight with an appearance by the eminent tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman. An intensely responsive soloist, he maneuvers with assurance as Mr. Alexander dances about him, bright chords and buzzing inflections laying fresh bait at every turn. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
After a rather draining few weeks in the public life of Kanye West comes this vivid verse, on a new Travis Scott song (produced by Pi’erre Bourne) with a cuddly Lil Uzi Vert chorus. Mr. West lets down the veil a bit, giving chum to voyeurs while also taking them to task:
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield?Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pillsBet my wifey stay close, she know I’m on my BezosOpioid addiction, pharmacy’s the real trapSometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil JackOne year it’s Illuminati, next year it’s the Sunken Place

Joe Casey, the vocalist and lyricist of the post-punk band Protomartyr, posits capitalism as a grim reaper in “Wheel of Fortune,” from the band’s coming EP. “I decide who lives and who dies,” he growls, with backup vocals from Kelley Deal of the Breeders turning it into a melody. The song is a suite of three disparate sections — two carrying lyrics, one wordless with a spooky high vocal, each section a crescendo of increasing density and dissonance. As the pressure rises, Mr. Casey observes things like “A man with a gun and a deluded sense of purpose/A good guy with a gun who missed/A police state desperate to reach quota.” No happy endings here. J.P.
The growl and holler of Parker Millsap’s vocals rough up his meticulous songwriting: terse wordplay, targeted melodies and detailed arrangements that deploy the instruments of a roots-rock band with rigorous economy. “Gotta Get to You,” from his new album “Other Arrangements,” takes obsession to existential extremes — “I’m cutting through the chatter/I’m battling the bleak abyss” — as shifting layers of acoustic and electric guitars make it rock furiously without any drums. J.P.
Carmen Perry is in a good mood delivering bad vibes on “The 1 Bad Man,” from Remember Sports’s third album, “Slow Buzz,” due later this month. When she sings, it’s potent and unsteady, and captures the anxiety of miscommunication — or rather, communicating at cross purposes — in tidy fashion. And behind her, the band is authoritatively slack on a mildly rootsy ramble. J.C.
Scraggly, slightly out of tune guitar picking runs through “Body Count,” but it shouldn’t be mistaken for fragility or diffidence. Jessie Reyez bluntly puts her partner of the moment on notice that she’s keeping things casual and staying autonomous. “Time won’t let you stay young,” she sings, “So we don’t care what they say/We gon’ love who we wanna love.” Abetted by the longtime producer and songwriter Babyface, the music stays sparse and cunning; trap percussion and blithe backup voices pop in, affirm her, and vanish. J.P.
Blissfully dim dance music for a summer on the beach and in the club (which is also on the beach). This song cements Balenciaga’s primacy in the popular fashion imagination — “Do you ever think about me? But you Balenciaga and Prada/that bougie kind of love ain’t cheap” — while also portending its doom following what may well be months of runway-themed fist pumps. J.C.
The cornetist, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Ben LaMar Gay has been recording music for a while — he just hasn’t been releasing it. “Downtown Castles Can Never Block the Sun,” his first official album, pulls from seven different discs he’s created over the past few years and passed around to family and friends. Based in both Chicago and Brazil, Mr. Gay is an artist with great conviction but no use for stability — or perhaps no trust in it. Herein lies dark soundscaping, tropicalia on tenterhooks, broken beat, Tuareg melodies, Bahía drumming. On the low, staticky murmur of “Uvas,” the sonic walls close in tight around you: You might hear it as claustrophobia, or comfort. G.R.
Even a superb singer needs songs. Leon Bridges, the Texas-based singer and songwriter whose voice harks back to both the suave tenderness and the churchy grit of Sam Cooke, is still underserved by his material on his major-label debut album, “Good Thing,” although he is now collaborating with song doctors like Justin Tranter and Ricky Reed. But “Mrs.,” a bluesy throwback to Southern soul tucked near the end of the album, approaches his potential. It’s about a combative but still amorous marriage — “I remember how it felt the first few times/Skin to skin before you knew how to get under mine” — and Mr. Bridges captures every bit of the ambivalent longing. J.P.
Tom Tripp is a young British singer with a tender and light voice that recalls a young Craig David, and this sweet and easy thumper is hypnotic minimal lite-soul with Afrobeats and dancehall flourishes. Sticky and coy. J.C.
Collaboration as collision fills “Venetian Snares x Daniel Lanois,” an album of improvisational duets between two Mr. Lanois on pedal steel guitar and Aaron Funk, a.k.a. Venetian Snares, on electronics that include real-time processing of the pedal steel. In “HpShk5050 P127,” Mr. Lanois sets out edgeless, weightless, swaying consonances; Venetian Snares zaps them with bursts of superhumanly frenetic percussion, teases at a near-reggae bass line and sends echoes skidding all around. They’re working at cross-purposes, but together. J.P.
Ganavya creates a lush twine out of American and South Asian traditions, and on “Aikyam: Onnu,” this vocalist and scholar’s majestic debut album, the upshot feels more like an expansive invitation than any definable hybrid. Ganavya has populated jazz standards with lyrics from Tamil poetry and songs of anticolonial resistance; the rendition of “Afro Blue” here features Oscar Brown’s typical lyrics as well as a devotional poem by Kanhopatra, a Marathi saint. No matter the language or the content, Ganavya’s voice is a thick ephemera, like smoke as dark as ink, just coming off the fire. G.R.
