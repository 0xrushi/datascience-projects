R. Kelly Again Denies Sexual Abuse Allegations (and an Unauthorized Denial)
The multiplatinum R&B singer R. Kelly, who is facing a renewed protest effort by activists who say he has sexually abused young girls and women for more than two decades, once again denied the growing list of accusations in a statement released by his management team on Friday.
The response came after a new report in BuzzFeed that detailed the accounts of two women, one of whom said she began sleeping with the singer when she was 17 — a year under the age of consent in Florida, where she lived — in 1995, and that he became mentally and physically abusive throughout a four-year relationship. A second woman told the publication that her 27-year-old daughter began dating the singer 10 years ago and is currently a member of what she called the singer’s abusive cult of women in Chicago and Atlanta.
“R. Kelly has close friendships with a number of women who are strong, independent, happy, well cared for and free to come and go as they please,” the singer’s management team said in its response. “We deny the many dark descriptions put forth by instigators and liars who have their own agenda for seeking profit and fame.”
The statement continued: “All of the women targeted by the current media onslaught are legal adults of sound mind and body, with their own free will. Law enforcement officials in Atlanta and Chicago previously have made ‘wellness’ visits to check on the women in question and have found nothing to cause alarm.”
Mr. Kelly, 51, is not facing any criminal charges and is not known to be under investigation.
Earlier this week, the Time’s Up organization, which began amid the #MeToo movement to address sexual abuse and assist its victims, threw its support — and boldfaced names — behind a grass-roots #MuteRKelly campaign to have his concerts and recording contracts canceled. “We demand appropriate investigations and inquiries into the allegations of R. Kelly’s abuse made by women of color and their families for over two decades now,” Time’s Up said in an open letter.
At the time, Mr. Kelly’s team likened the campaign to a hate crime. “We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture,” it said in a statement.
Since last summer, those behind the #MuteRKelly campaign have petitioned venues and promoters that have agreed to host the singer, pointing to his history of civil settlements with women who have said he abused them. (Mr. Kelly was acquitted in 2008 of child pornography charges.)
A representative for the Greensboro Coliseum Complex, which is scheduled to host a concert by R. Kelly on May 11, said in an email on Friday that the show was “still a go.” Mr. Kelly’s label, RCA Records, a division of Sony Music, declined to comment earlier this week, and they did not respond to follow-up requests for comment on Friday.
In a confounding turn, Mr. Kelly’s management also denounced on Friday a statement attributed to the singer that was published by The Associated Press. The statement — which called the singer “a God-fearing man, a son, a brother, and most importantly a father” whose legacy was being destroyed — was sent in an unauthorized news release by RKellyTours.com, his management team said.
“Mr. Kelly rejects the points the statement tries to make, and we deny all association with it,” his team added. “We are looking into what went wrong here.”
