Spinning Melody: The Best Classical Music of the Week
Our critics and reporters offer a glimpse of what’s moved and delighted them over the past week. Read the rest of our classical music coverage here.
What a relief it was when Lawrence Brownlee — after a timid take on Schumann’s “Dichterliebe” and the challenging New York premiere of Tyshawn Sorey’s “Cycles of My Being” — came back onstage at Zankel Hall on Tuesday with an encore: the oft-covered 1940 song “The Nearness of You.” Mr. Brownlee became a star through the bel canto repertory, but he is also an excellent interpreter of traditional songs and standards. In “The Nearness of You,” recorded here with his collaborator, the nimble pianist Myra Huang, you can hear character and depth that were unfortunately missing from his foray into Schumann’s cycle. (It was also difficult to hear anyone else’s “Dichterliebe” in the shadow of Mark Padmore’s brilliant account with Paul Lewis less than a week before.) Around 40 seconds in, Mr. Brownlee’s coloratura cred comes in handy for satisfying, sweet ornamentation on the words “oh my.” JOSHUA BARONE

I join the disappointment with Lawrence Brownlee’s practiced, bland “Dichterliebe.” But I was also underwhelmed on Tuesday by “Cycles of My Being,” and that’s as a great admirer of its composer, Tyshawn Sorey. The texts, by the poet Terrance Hayes, were stiff (“could it be that you hate me because you hate yourself?”) and produced stiff music: The score — for violin, cello, clarinet and piano, in addition to voice — was diffident and dreary. Mr. Sorey has done extreme elongation before, as in his evening-length collaboration with the brilliant young soprano Julia Bullock on arrangements of Josephine Baker songs. But in that larger-scale endeavor, there was a more imaginative range of colors and textures, and the super-deliberate pace provided time and space to reflect on subtexts and nuances that were lacking in “Cycles of My Being.” Here’s that gorgeous Baker work, either to dip into or to watch in its 90-minute entirety.

Weill Recital Hall, the smallest space at Carnegie Hall, is used most often these days for concerts by young artists. So I jumped at the opportunity on Monday to see the distinguished Swiss cellist Thomas Demenga there, under the auspices of the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation. (Mr. Demenga won the Naumburg Prize in 1977.) It was a rare chance to hear a musician at the top of his game in such an intimate setting, and the audience was rewarded with an elegant program juxtaposing Bach and modern music, all performed with calm confidence. I especially loved his smoky, seductive take on the second Minuet of Bach’s first solo-cello suite; you can get a sense, though paler than the live version, of what he did at 1:17 on this track, part of a recent recording of all six suites on the ECM label.

The cello is a bowed instrument — except when it is not. In addition to Bach, Mr. Demenga played Elliott Carter, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s Sonata for Solo Cello (1960) at his excellent solo evening on Monday at Weill. For considerable stretches of the Zimmermann — in the movements “Tropi” and “Spazi” (“Tropes” and “Spaces”) — beginning at 6 minutes in this 2015 video from Bern, Switzerland — Mr. Demenga used only his left, fingering hand to determine not just the pitch and character of the sound, but also its rhythm and color. It almost made Bach look easy. JAMES R. OESTREICH
The young Russian pianist Daniil Trifonov, who programmed two substantive and adventurous Chopin programs this week at Carnegie Hall, is both a sensitive and virtuosic interpreter of that composer. Chopin figured prominently in the event that brought Mr. Trifonov, then 20, to international attention, when he won the 2011 Arthur Rubinstein competition in Tel Aviv. Here he is during the competition playing Chopin’s 12 Études (Op. 25). Listen to the sixth, in G-sharp Minor. Mr. Trifonov’s playing is so fleet, gossamer and charming, you won’t even notice that the piece requires pages of finger-twisting double thirds. ANTHONY TOMMASINI

With Mr. Trifonov’s Chopin programs, I have Chopin on my mind. I had a mini-revelation while taking in this video of the brilliant clarinetist Martin Fröst playing the somber Andante from Witold Lutoslawski’s “Dance Preludes” for clarinet, harp, piano and strings with the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra. I kept heard echoes of Chopin, however unlikely — at least in the way the elegiac melody spins on and on. Chopin’s melodic writing was influenced by Polish folk idioms to some degree, and a lot by bel canto opera. The clarinet melody in this 1955 piece unfolds slowly, in hushed tones, winding like some latter-day Chopin nocturne over a walking bass line. And catch the bustling, dancing rhythm energy of the following movement, an Allegro. Mr. Fröst plays dazzlingly. ANTHONY TOMMASINI
Encore! The rising young soprano Nadine Sierra, 29, took home the Beverly Sills Artist Award this week — a $50,000 prize given each year to an artist between 25 and 40 who has sung a featured solo role at the Metropolitan Opera. That makes back-to-back honors for her: Last year she won the prestigious Richard Tucker Award. She has emerged as a Mozartian at the Met in recent seasons, singing Zerlina in “Don Giovanni,” Susanna in “Le Nozze di Figaro,” and, here, Ilia in “Idomeneo.” In “Padre, germani, addio,” Ms. Sierra’s bright, sweet, supple voice sounds almost effortless as she sings the tricky passages that limn the grief, guilt and love of Ilia, an imprisoned Trojan princess in love with her Greek captor.

It was 1926, a year before “The Jazz Singer” would usher in the end of the silent film era and the rise of talkies. Vitaphone wanted to show off its new sound technology, so they filmed the New York Philharmonic playing a few minutes of Wagner’s “Tannhäuser.” It is believed to be the earliest film where you can hear an orchestra playing. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote that “one was not only impressed by the clarity of the tonal colors and softer interludes, but also by the thrilling volume of the full orchestra.” His review anticipated the Metropolitan Opera’s Live in HD cinema broadcasts by the better part of a century. “The future of this new contrivance is boundless,” he wrote, “for inhabitants of small and remote places will have the opportunity of listening to and seeing grand opera as it is give in New York.” MICHAEL COOPER

Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic arrive at Lincoln Center on Friday, and they bring a breathtaking program. I heard it at Symphony Hall in Boston on Wednesday, and can report that it fully lived up to the hype surrounding what one of my colleagues has called “the most important orchestra in America.” A new piece by Esa-Pekka Salonen, “Pollux,” was a disappointment, curiously uninventive and too obviously in love with the lush palettes of a full orchestra. But Mr. Dudamel, who nowadays seems less and less a showman, convinced with a desperate, hollow account of Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5, and even more in Varèse’s “Amériques,” a raucous, turbulent and, above all, loud piece that is absurdly difficult and yet seemed a breeze to this orchestra’s players.

On Saturday at Issue Project Room, the composer-performer David Behrman introduced a quietly compelling piece, “Recorders,” recently developed in collaboration with Cleek Schrey, a violinist and sometime recorder player. But Mr. Behrman also brought back some past works. For me, the most rewarding moment came when Mr. Schrey worked a change on the veteran composer’s “Interspecies Smalltalk” — an electroacoustic piece that appeared on Mr. Behrman’s transporting 1991 album “Leapday Night.”
On that recording, some lyrical violin playing by Takehisa Kosugi tended to work in close tandem with mellow ostinatos produced by the composer’s computer system (which, in his words, comes with “ears” that it uses to listen and react to live musicians). On Saturday, Mr. Schrey communicated some of that same lyricism. But he also ventured brief passages of percussive pizzicato, which in turn elicited some lightly rumbling timbres from Mr. Behrman’s electronic setup — and a subtle increase in experimental edge.
