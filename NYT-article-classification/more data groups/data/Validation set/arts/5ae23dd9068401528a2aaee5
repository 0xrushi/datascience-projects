7 Classical Music Concerts to See in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
LEIF OVE ANDSNES at David Geffen Hall (May 2, 7:30 p.m.). The New York Philharmonic’s artist in residence gives a recital that provides an insight into how this superb musician’s mind works: There’s straight down-the-line core repertoire, notably Beethoven’s “Tempest” Sonata and late Schubert, but also repertoire that few other pianists shine a light on, including Nielsen, several short pieces by Sibelius and “Idyll and Abyss,” by Jörg Widmann.212-875-5656, nyphil.org
MAHAN ESFAHANI at Weill Recital Hall (May 1, 7:30 p.m.). You will need to call for returns to this harpsichordist’s concert at Carnegie, and rightly so: He is an essential and provocative artist. The music is a typical fare of Frescobaldi, Benda, Rameau and Bach.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
GERALD FINLEY AND JULIUS DRAKE at Alice Tully Hall (May 2, 7:30 p.m.). Mr. Finley, one of our leading bass-baritones, has always been highly regarded for his sensitivity to text, making him as strong in the recital hall as he is on the opera stage. Here he sings lieder by Beethoven and Schubert, songs by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, and favorite folk tunes.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (April 27, 8 p.m.; April 29, 3 p.m.). My colleague Zachary Woolfe has declared that while the Cleveland Orchestra is the best in America, the Los Angeles Philharmonic is the most important, not least for the daring of its programming and the capaciousness of its vision for what an orchestra can and should be. Only parts of that vision make it to New York for this stop on the ensemble’s tour, but there’s still much to look forward to. On Friday, Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5 is prefaced by Varèse’s “Amériques” and a new piece by Esa-Pekka Salonen, “Pollux”; for Sunday’s matinee, Bernstein’s “Chichester Psalms” introduces Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9. Gustavo Dudamel conducts.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (May 3, 7:30 p.m., through May 8). He may have been beaten to the music directorship by Jaap van Zweden, or so rumor has it, but Manfred Honeck remains the finest musician mounting the Philharmonic’s podium on a regular basis. His concerts have been some of the orchestra’s finest in the past few years. He conducts selections from Tchaikovsky’s “Sleeping Beauty,” his own “Rusalka Fantasy” — a suite arranged from Dvorak’s opera with the aid of Thomas Ille — and Sibelius’s Violin Concerto. Nikolaj Znaider, who plays the Sibelius with cold fire, is the soloist.212-875-5656, nyphil.org
NOVUS NY at Trinity Wall Street (May 3, 1 p.m.). Trust Julian Wachner, who has turned Trinity Wall Street into a musical powerhouse, to take an unusually interesting approach to an anniversary that has dominated so much of the classical music season, that of Leonard Bernstein’s 100th birthday. Throughout this series, “Total Embrace,” the free concerts have included music by Bernstein himself, music he was associated with as a conductor, music by other composer-conductors and new music by composers working today. This Thursday, see the premiere of Mr. Wachner’s “Epistle Mass,” as well as Mahler’s “Kindertotenlieder,” sung by Stephen Salters.212-602-0800, trinitywallstreet.org/music-arts
MAURIZIO POLLINI at Carnegie Hall (April 29, 2 p.m.). Detractors lament Mr. Pollini’s loss of dexterity and technical accomplishment in his eighth decade, but they tend to think that precision is all he ever had. Those who think that view wrong, as I do, would be wise to hear this pianist at every opportunity. Chopin and Debussy make up the bill.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
