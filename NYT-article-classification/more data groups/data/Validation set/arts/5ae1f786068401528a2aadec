Tumult at an Italian Opera House: A Major Conductor Leaves Turin
The Italian conductor Gianandrea Noseda, whose American career has taken off in recent years with his appointment as music director of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington and with high-profile performances at the Metropolitan Opera, announced on Thursday that he was leaving the Teatro Regio Torino, the Italian opera house he has helped restore to prominence over the past decade.
It was the latest instance of a renowned Italian conductor finding disharmony at an Italian opera house: In 2005, Riccardo Muti resigned from the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.
Mr. Noseda, 54, said in a statement that he had been told that the Teatro Regio, which has been going through administrative upheaval this year, had canceled its planned tour of the United States next spring, which would have taken it to Carnegie Hall, Chicago and Washington. Carnegie confirmed that the Teatro Regio had informed it that the company was canceling its United States tour.
The Teatro Regio appointed a new superintendent, William Graziosi, this week, which means Mr. Noseda would have had to reapply to keep his post as music director, the position he has held since 2007. Instead, he took his name out of contention, calling the theater’s recent actions “disappointing and disheartening.”
“The fact that the quality which has propelled the theater on the international scene has not been taken in due consideration,” Mr. Noseda said in the statement, “provides a clear indication to me that there is no interest to share a common vision for the future of the Teatro Regio Torino.”
Mr. Noseda has clashed with the company’s leadership before, sometimes being drawn into public disputes with its former superintendent, Walter Vergnano. But he was widely credited with lifting the company’s reputation: improving its musical quality, helping attract corporate sponsors and winning international acclaim through recordings and tours, including with a rapturously received one of the United States in 2014.
Mr. Noseda said that he would honor upcoming conducting engagements this summer, and praised the company.
“Once again, I thank the incredible artists of the orchestra and the chorus, the stage technicians, all the workshops workers and the staff members who shared a common vision for the Teatro Regio Torino,” he said. “We have produced so much great art together, and this will remain forever in the history of the house, as well as in our personal histories.”
Mr. Vergnano, the company’s outgoing general manager, issued a statement Friday “to make some clarifications in order to preserve Teatro Regio’s image.” He said that the company had worked hard to raise money for next year’s United States tour but had come up short.
He said that he viewed Mr. Noseda’s departure — which, he noted pointedly, was announced in a statement to the press — as having “nothing to do” with an Italian law with a provision for music directors to end their terms along with the general managers who appointed them.
“I wish that Teatro Regio may find as soon as possible the serenity essential to carry on the great work achieved in the last years and recognized in Torino and all over the world,” Mr. Vergnano said.
