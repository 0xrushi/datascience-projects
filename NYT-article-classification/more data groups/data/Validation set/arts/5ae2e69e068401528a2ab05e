Nora Fischer Bursts the Classical Music Bubble
HAMBURG — You may remember Nora Fischer as the soprano who gave buoyant performances of Monteverdi’s “Vi ricorda ò boschi ombrosi” at prestigious concert halls across Europe this season, her sweetly vibrant voice rising over the theorbo accompaniment. Or you may have caught her at a pop festival with another version of that same 400-year-old song, this time joined by electric guitar.
Either way, she is likely to have made an impression.
Ms. Fischer, 30, is making her mark in the blurry terrain between classical music and pop. The daughter of the conductor Ivan Fischer and the recorder player Anneke Boeke, the classics were always going to be at the root of her artistry. But, as she said in an interview after a performance at the Elbphilharmonie here, “I knew I wanted to sing, but all of the carved-out paths were just not for me.”
Making her own way has meant constant invention. On her new album, “Hush,” she is joined by the electric guitarist Marnix Dorrestein in early Baroque pieces, often transposing them down to keys that allow for a more natural, pop-like style, devoid of vibrato and ornamentation.
At the same time, her affinity with experimental classical styles and her sharp dramatic instincts have encouraged composers to tailor works to her. Louis Andriessen is writing her an orchestral song cycle, which the Los Angeles Philharmonic will perform next season, and Osvaldo Golijov is at work writing a piece for her and the Silk Road Ensemble. On April 29, New Yorkers can catch Ms. Fischer at National Sawdust in Brooklyn in “The Secret Diary of Nora Plain,” a haunting cycle about privacy, surveillance and erotic obsession.
In a phone interview, Morris Kliphuis, the composer of “Nora Plain,” said that writing music for Ms. Fischer means “I can basically write anything, even the weirdest stuff, and she’ll just hit it.”
In the song “Rat in My Room,” Ms. Fischer begins in a low speaking voice, then explodes in a volley of obsessively repeated phrases shot through with grunge-metal yelps. In performances of classical works, like Ravel’s “Kaddish,” which is part of her recital tour this summer, she produces impeccably turned phrases in a soprano of mountain-stream clarity.
But even then, the infusion of a little more air, or the tiniest hint of vocal fry on a low note, evokes other musical worlds. (Mr. Andriessen said, of one of her heated moments in his opera “Theater of the World”: “I was very impressed by the screaming. It was in tune and very professional.”)
Ms. Fischer’s direct, close-to-speech singing did not always go down well with everyone. She was kicked out of conservatory in Amsterdam after a single semester. “I didn’t like this typical classical way of singing,” she said, “always with huge vibrato and always loud.”
After a stint studying musicology and philosophy, she entered a degree program in Copenhagen that emphasized stylistic versatility. “My vocal cords just opened up,” she said. “I got out of the classical bubble, and I learned to use my voice in so many ways.”
For a while her father was concerned. “He was always asking, ‘Are you working on your technique?’ ” she recalled. “He’s a bit traditional in the way that he would think that classical singing is the only healthy way to sing.”
But since then, Ms. Fischer has performed some of Mr. Fischer’s own (classical) compositions, and he has expressed pride in her career. In any case, he is known for shaking up conventions himself: At concerts of the Budapest Festival Orchestra, which he leads, listeners are sometimes seated among the orchestra members; players might sing an encore.
“My father will also never go down the path that has been set for him,” Ms. Fischer said. “So it’s also a bit his fault. He really encouraged me — though perhaps not actively — to always set your own rules, to always place a question mark.”
One question that unites them is how to engage audiences. For Ms. Fischer’s final project for her master’s degree at The Hague University in the Netherlands, she created a culinary concert, during which she cooked and served food while singing folk songs. “Hush” was born out of a desire to share her love for Baroque music with listeners who might be put off by the frills of classical singing.
“In a way they are like singer-songwriter songs,” Ms. Fischer said. “In most of the early songs you just get a melody and a bass line — it’s actually like a jazz lead sheet.”
Mr. Dorrestein, the guitarist, said in a phone interview that he hadn’t known the Baroque repertory when she suggested they perform it. “But a lot of people that come from my background are very excited,” he added. “They feel that there is a reason this music survived for as long as it did.”
Mr. Andriessen compared her to two hyperflexible singers he has worked with: Cristina Zavalloni and Cathy Berberian.
“All have that quality of having a lot of possibilities in their voice,” he said. “They are like composers: They can do this and they can do that.”
