14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to pop and rock shows and the best of live jazz happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ABRA at 31st Street and 10th Avenue (May 3, 7 p.m.). There’s big money behind the Shed, an ambitious new arts center opening next year near the High Line. Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, for one, has given at least $75 million to the project. You can preview the Shed’s philosophy at a series of free concerts starting in the coming week at a lot near the future site, including this show by the Atlanta-based songwriter Abra, whose sound blends post-punk, R&B and electronics. While many R.S.V.P. spots have already been claimed, more are expected to be made available as the date approaches.theshed.org
DREAM WIFE at Rough Trade NYC (May 1, 8:30 p.m.). Formed in 2015 at a British art school, Dream Wife play streamlined rock ’n’ roll with an energy that’s anything but academic. Their recent self-titled debut LP is a treat for anyone who wishes the Strokes and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs still sounded like they did in the early 2000s. And while this sort of music sounds great on record, it’s virtually guaranteed to be exponentially more fun in a club setting.888-929-7849, roughtradenyc.com
ELEANOR FRIEDBERGER at Bowery Ballroom (May 1, 9 p.m.). On such superb solo albums as “Personal Record” (2013) and “New View” (2016) — not to mention the excellently weird music she made in the 2000s as half of the Fiery Furnaces — Eleanor Friedberger has set herself apart as one of indie rock’s sharpest narrators. With “Rebound,” her fourth solo LP, Ms. Friedberger swerves toward New Romantic balladry, with echoes of the ’80s goth disco in Greece that gave the album its name.877-987-6487, mercuryeastpresents.com/boweryballroom
HALF WAIF at Baby’s All Right (April 27, 8 p.m.). “I miss New York, and that’s the loneliest feeling,” Nandi Rose Plunkett sings on “Lavender,” her second album (coming out on Friday) as Half Waif. Ms. Plunkett left the roots-rock band Pinegrove last summer to focus on this synth-pop project, and that decision pays dividends in the subtle, introspective music. The leisurely Texas duo Hovvdy opens.877-987-6487, babysallright.com
LAST RITES at the Silent Barn (April 29, 8 p.m.). This event space has been a crucial hub of D.I.Y. music and community activism for more than a decade, first in Ridgewood, Queens, and later at its current location in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The news of its permanent closure this spring due to financial pressure arrived with a feeling of sad inevitability — gentrification spares no club. Before the Silent Barn ceases operation on April 30, it will host one final show: a “funeral service” offering D.J. sets and performances by such habitués as Shady Hawkins, Mallrat and Crosslegged, and an opportunity to say goodbye to one of the city’s most beloved hangouts.silentbarn.org
NO AGE at Brooklyn Bazaar (May 2, 9 p.m.). L.A.’s No Age make punk rock in only the most nominal sense these days: Their guitars are still distorted, but the noise is just a means to a very pretty end. That’s truer than ever on “Snares Like a Haircut,” the duo’s dreamiest album to date. Come get lost in the sound at this Brooklyn show.877-987-6487, bkbazaar.com
SUNFLOWER BEAN at Space Ninety 8 (April 27, 7 p.m.). History suggests that 22 is a good age for a popular musician to be. That’s how old Paul McCartney was in the year of “A Hard Day’s Night” and Prince in the year of “Dirty Mind”; when Taylor Swift was 22, she dedicated an entire hit song to how it felt. This explains in part how confident and cool Sunflower Bean, all three members of which recently turned that magic age, sound on “Twenty-Two in Blue,” their second full-length album. This performance in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is free with purchase of the LP, and it’s a good option for anyone who missed Sunflower Bean’s recent sold-out Bowery Ballroom show.uospaces.com/ninety8

TIM BERNE/HANK ROBERTS DUO AND CAROLINE DAVIS QUARTET at Korzo (May 1, 9 p.m.). Here are two disarming alto saxophonists working in different lanes of modern jazz: Tim Berne, a runic experimentalist with a slippery tone, and Caroline Davis, whose own original music takes the form of carefully threaded, fluent post-bop. Mr. Berne just released a fine new album, “Angel Dusk,” in duet with the pianist Matt Mitchell; he appears at Korzo with a different partner, the cellist Hank Roberts. Ms. Davis will play first, joined by Julian Shore on piano, Tamir Shmerling on bass and Jay Sawyer on drums.facebook.com/konceptions
DJANGO FESTIVAL ALL-STARS at Carnegie Hall (May 1, 8 p.m.). The Django Festival All-Stars go a little bit beyond celebrating their namesake, Django Reinhardt, the Romani French guitarist known as gypsy jazz’s main hero. Their songbook includes many items from Reinhardt’s repertoire, as well as originals by the group’s own band members inspired by the broader field of early 20th-century jazz. At this concert, the founding bandleader Dorado Schmitt will pass the All-Stars’ mantle to his sons Samson and Amati, who are both guitarists. The show features appearances from a few special guests, including the vocalist Melody Gardot and the clarinetist Ken Peplowski.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN IN JAZZ FESTIVAL at St. Peter’s Church (April 28, 1 p.m.). Charenee Wade’s warm voice can swing easily from the earthy to the seraphic. She’s the headlining performer at this daylong festival, which begins with an early-afternoon jam session and also includes appearances by the vocalist Debbie Goodridge and the pianist Dotti Anita Taylor. The young vocalist Kameelah Harper, the winner of the International Women in Jazz Youth in Action prize, will also perform.212-560-7553, internationalwomeninjazz.org
JUNEBUG FESTIVAL at Happylucky No. 1 (May 2-4, 8 p.m.). Situated in the heart of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, this art gallery and performance space has recently become a reliable presenter of experimental improvised music, often engaging some of New York’s top talent. The Junebug Festival is a prime example: Over three days, the gallery will welcome two ensembles each night, including Amirtha Kidambi’s explosive quartet, Elder Ones, on Wednesday; the hyperarticulate guitarist Liberty Ellman’s trio on Thursday; and the renowned bassist Reggie Workman in an intriguing trio with the electronic musician Ikue Mori and the flutist Redi Fernández on May 4.646-623-0414, happyluckyno1.com
ARTURO O’FARRILL AND FRIENDS at New York City Center (April 28, 8 p.m.). The five-day ¡Adelante, Cuba! Festival ends with a gathering of major talents from across the spectrum of Cuban performance. At the helm is the pianist Mr. O’Farrill, whose Afro Latin Jazz Orchestra will serve as the house band. Also taking the stage are the poet and rapper Telmary Diaz, the vocalist Omara Portuondo, the pianist Roberto Fonseca, the all-female string orchestra Camerata Romeu, the trumpet player Yasek Manzano and the tap artist Ayodele Casel.212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org
CHUCHO VALDÉS at the Blue Note (through April 29 and May 1-6, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). Earlier this week, Mr. Valdés, a Latin jazz patriarch, began an extended run at the Blue Note that will find him flexing his powers in a variety of contexts. Through Sunday, he performs with a midsize ensemble, celebrating the 45th anniversary of the founding of Irakere, his watershed Cuban fusion band. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he’s joined by the trumpeter Roy Hargrove and the vocalist Roberta Gambarini; on Thursday, he performs alone; and from May 4 to 6, he’ll be accompanied by Ron Carter. (The drummer Lenny White joins Mr. Valdés and Mr. Carter for the last two dates, with the violinist Regina Carter coming aboard for the final evening.)212-475-8592, bluenote.net
DARRYL YOKLEY at Smoke (May 3, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Yokley, an enterprising young tenor saxophonist, composed each of the 13 tunes for his new album, “Pictures at an African Exhibition,” in collaboration with the artist David Emmanuel Noel, who painted a different canvas for each tune. Recorded with a large ensemble, the music has a hustling, declaratory spirit and a broadly Pan-African take on acoustic jazz, with touchstones spanning from the Antilles to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. He celebrates the release with a quartet featuring the brothers Zaccai and Luques Curtis — whose Truth Revolution Records released the album — on piano and bass, and Mark Whitfield II on drums.212-864-6662, smokejazz.com
