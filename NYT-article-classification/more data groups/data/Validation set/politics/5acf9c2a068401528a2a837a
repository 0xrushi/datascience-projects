Is It Even Possible to Succeed as House G.O.P. Speaker?
The speaker of the House’s institutional responsibilities date to the founding of our country, but the modern speakership is focused largely on its political roles: protecting the House majority and advancing the party’s policy goals. Success in one dimension — as Speaker Paul Ryan’s decision to retire reflects — does not always translate into success in the other.
In the context of protecting Republican control, there’s little reason to think that Mr. Ryan would be a liability to Republicans’ prospects of holding a majority. A February Politico/Morning Consult poll put Mr. Ryan’s national favorability at an anemic 36 percent, but he has not been used — at least to this point — as a high-profile symbolic figure in Democrats’ campaigns to retake the House of Representatives. A recent analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project of roughly 300,000 House and Senate campaign ads aired since January 2017 indicates that unfavorable mentions of Mr. Ryan (0.3 percent of airings) were much less common than negative depictions of President Trump (6 percent) and the minority leader, Nancy Pelosi (2.4 percent).
The biggest factors affecting what happens in November, according to political science research, are not things like the speaker of the House but so-called fundamentals, like presidential approval, the state of the economy and the number of seats the majority party is defending. And the president’s party is almost always likely to take a beating; in only three midterm elections since 1934 has the party controlling the White House gained seats. Mr. Ryan’s retirement is not likely to break these trends.
So let’s assume Mr. Ryan isn’t an exceptional Republican political liability. What about on policy? We can assess his record by looking at what bills the speaker decided to consider in the House. For that, there are two dynamics to assess: One involves keeping things off the agenda that could split the party, even if they could pass the House with votes chipped in from the other party. As Dennis Hastert, a former speaker, put it, “The job of the speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the majority.” The second dynamic entails advancing policies favored by his party.
As speaker, Mr. Ryan has proved successful at the first. Take, for example, the recent stalemate on immigration. At various points over the past several months, the speaker has kept several immigration proposals — endorsed by both more and less conservative wings of his caucus — off the House floor, protecting some members from purple or blue districts from potentially difficult votes while also avoiding pushback from his most conservative bloc for advancing a more moderate bill.
But it’s hard to sustain a speakership solely on the ability to keep things off the agenda, and Mr. Ryan was notably prone to overpromising what was possible to get done. At the start of the new Congress in 2017, he assured Republicans that they would repeal Obamacare, cut taxes and fund President Trump’s proposed border wall before the August recess. But only one of those goals has been meaningfully accomplished, and even it — the tax bill — came much later than Mr. Ryan promised. Internal divisions within the House Republican conference, combined with a narrow Senate majority, certainly bear much of the responsibility for this lack of major accomplishments.
But when one party controls the House, the Senate and the presidency — a relatively unusual occurrence over the past 40 years — it bears greater responsibility for getting things done. In addition, Mr. Ryan failed to deliver on early promises to open up deliberation to more input from rank-and-file House members. Those process complaints are unlikely to register with voters, but they may have increased frustration among caucus members already unhappy with the lack of policy progress.
If Democrats were to take control of the House in November, a postelection departure by Mr. Ryan wouldn’t have been surprising; it’s unusual for a losing speaker to continue to lead his party in the minority. (Ms. Pelosi is a notable exception.) But even if Republicans retain control of the House in November, the challenges presented to Mr. Ryan in terms of racking up policy wins were likely to get worse, not better.
The House seats most likely to be lost by Republicans in November are largely held by members who generally cooperate with Mr. Ryan, leaving behind a smaller majority with a more extreme center of gravity. Senate Republicans face kinder headwinds — 10 Democratic incumbents are running for re-election in states that Mr. Trump carried — and are more likely to retain control of their chamber; they may even gain a few seats. But a filibuster-proof Senate majority in 2019 is extremely unlikely, and the level of polarization in the Senate means that building a coalition in the Senate that attracts, say, seven Democratic senators may not be meaningfully different from the current task of garnering the support of nine.
Together, these forces would have left Mr. Ryan to deal with a worse version of his current dilemma on must-pass measures like large spending bills: Any measure that can clear the Senate is likely to need some Democratic support in the House to pass.
Should Republicans control the House for the 116th Congress, the two leading candidates to succeed Mr. Ryan — the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and the House majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana — will face this same difficulty in fulfilling one of the speaker’s basic political responsibilities. Both Mr. Ryan and Mr. Boehner chaired full House committees before becoming speaker; neither Mr. McCarthy nor Mr. Scalise has. During the contentious debates over the Republicans’ health care and tax bills in 2017, Mr. McCarthy helped to ensure that nearly all of his fellow California Republicans voted for both measures. Given the potential negative consequences of both bills for the state, that was a difficult task, and this political skill could prove valuable as a speaker trying to move an affirmative agenda.
But to avoid the pitfalls that have plagued Mr. Ryan, any Republican successor will be wise to avoid making promises on which he or she can’t deliver.
