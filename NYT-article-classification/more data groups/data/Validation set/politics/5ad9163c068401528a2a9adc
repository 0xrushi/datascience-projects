Trailblazers in Politics and Civil Rights
Two recent biographies may galvanize readers currently feeling cheated by a shortage of contemporary political heroes.
I, for one, can never get enough of New York’s 1920s governor Alfred E. Smith, whom Robert Chiles, a history lecturer at the University of Maryland, reanimates in “The Revolution of ’28: Al Smith, American Progressivism, and the Coming of the New Deal” (Cornell University Press).
In his distillation of the many volumes by earlier biographers, Mr. Chiles distinguishes Smith’s local progressivism from the national liberal agenda that Franklin D. Roosevelt labeled the New Deal and imposed in response to the Depression.
But in contextualizing the two, he writes that both were framed by the same collaboration of female social welfare advocates (like Frances Perkins) and enlightened Tammany proxies (like Robert F. Wagner).
“Smith is the first child of the new immigration who might be president of the United States,” Walter Lippmann predicted in 1927.
He won the Democratic nomination in 1928 and campaigned as “The Happy Warrior.” But he was soundly defeated, doomed as a Catholic from New York who regarded Prohibition as an intemperate anti-immigrant indignity. Herbert Hoover, who could justifiably campaign as a progressive Republican, pigeonholed Smith as an advocate of state socialism (the same epithet that a spiteful Smith would hurl at Roosevelt in 1936).
Smith was embittered by the ignominious loss of his home state in 1928 and the underwhelming margin in his own city. H. L. Mencken lamented that Smith had been “ruined by associating with rich men.” Senator Joseph T. Robinson, Democrat of Arkansas, concluded flat out that “the brown derby has been discarded for the high hat.”
Still, Smith’s Shakespearean fall produced an enduring legacy. After his defeat in 1928, Mencken advised: “The future of the Democracy lies in following the furrow plowed by Al.” Roosevelt would do just that.
Constance Baker Motley’s first encounter with Jim Crow was traveling by train from New Haven through New York to attend Fisk University, the historically black college, in Nashville. In Cincinnati, she had to disembark and switch to a segregated passenger car.
She later transferred to New York University, graduated from Columbia Law School and clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall.
As the first female lawyer hired by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, she drafted the original complaint in the Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation case. Representing James Meredith’s effort to enroll in the University of Mississippi in 1962, she was the first black woman to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
She was later the first woman elected Manhattan borough president and the first black female federal judge.
Though her résumé was grist for a full-fledged profile, until now the only one was her autobiography “Equal Justice Under Law” (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1998).
In “Constance Baker Motley: One Woman’s Fight for Civil Rights and Equal Justice Under Law” (The University of Alabama Press), Gary L. Ford Jr., an assistant professor at Lehman College, convincingly argues that “her agency and actions provide persuasive evidence that formal male activism should no longer be viewed as the only style of leadership that was effective or acceptable during the civil rights movement.”
