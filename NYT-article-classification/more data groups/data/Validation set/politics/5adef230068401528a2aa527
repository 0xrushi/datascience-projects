Online or in Politics, ‘Backlash’ Is as Predictable as Weather
Is it possible that anger qualifies, at this point, as a national pastime? It roils our cultural dialogue, poisons social media and — as is frequently, and somewhat helplessly, observed — it curdles much of our politics into a zero-sum game of tribal loathing. It is the predictable response to almost any new development, significant or otherwise: Whatever happens, someone’s fury will most likely rise to meet it, and in the right conditions, it will gather quickly into an entire campaign of “backlash.”
One day it may be those railing against a perceived war on Christmas. The next it may be social media users enraged by changes to their favorite platforms. Another it may be television viewers irked that a problematic show is getting adoring press. Sometimes the backlash will come from a group that sees itself as marginalized, hemmed in by hostile and entrenched adversaries; sometimes it will come from those who merely see themselves as being righteously on the side of the unduly oppressed; sometimes it will seem to happen reflexively, like an involuntary spasm. But in every case, there will be those who find themselves aggrieved by something they believe is intolerably dominating the cultural landscape.
The difficulty is that not all of those people can be correct. We can’t all be fighting the prevailing orthodoxy, can we?
Last July, a Google engineer named James Damore wrote an internal memo criticizing what he saw as “authoritarian” diversity practices at the tech giant, suggesting along the way that women and men might be biologically suited to different professional roles. He was swiftly fired, but the furor the episode created in Silicon Valley spilled rapidly outward. While Google executives rushed to condemn the memo and reaffirm their commitment to an inclusive workplace, alt-right provocateurs were embracing Damore as a political martyr, harassed out of his job by an oppressive and hypocritical liberal machine. What began as a question of corporate values quickly transformed into a larger skirmish between competing perceptions of who actually wields power in America.
Damore would go on to file a class-action suit claiming that conservative white men were systematically discriminated against at Google, including as evidence colleagues’ aggressive responses to his memo — a reaction The Guardian characterized as an “internal backlash.” Many of Damore’s co-workers, of course, had credibly argued that the only systematic discrimination here was found in Damore’s memo itself: “You have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment,” wrote one former colleague upon reading it. The Financial Times saw “backlash” in a whole separate layer of reaction: the flurry of vitriol and threats directed at Google from conservative activists, which compelled management to cancel a town-hall meeting on diversity issues.
There are obvious differences in the types of power each side of this conflict could credibly suggest the other possessed. But the dynamics involved are typical, and you can spot them in any number of contentious issues. One faction positions itself as a beleaguered voice of dissent, bravely pushing back against some draconian orthodoxy. The other sees itself as battling a society already suffused in this supposedly “dissenting” viewpoint. Each side looks at the world around it and sees, for the most part, the flourishing of the other. It’s less a culture war than a war over who’s already winning.
“Backlash” was originally a mechanical-engineering term: It describes the gap between two parts of a machine, and the slight jolt that occurs when one of those parts, springing into motion, meets the next. The appeal of the metaphor is obvious, given that it maps so neatly onto human behavior. Around a decade ago, as the nation’s social media addiction took hold — prompting everyone to broadcast intense feelings about new topics each day — “backlash” was a useful means of describing the machinelike way public opinion could shift around any given pop-culture concern. First would come sustained praise for a film or song or celebrity; then that praise would start a groundswell of resistance, naysaying and condemnation; then all that hostility would arouse a volley of even more ardent adulation; and so on.
“It is a pop-culture law that everything generates a backlash,” The Ringer observed earlier this year, before pointing out that the ensuing cycles of opinion — from initial hype to stubborn critiques to indignant defenses — were now so familiar they could be predicted with almost scientific precision. It went on to do exactly that for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” a film about which you could eventually find some people arguing “everyone loves this movie, but I hate it” and others declaring that “everyone is criticizing this movie, but they’re wrong” — viewpoints that only grew more heated and high-stakes as they dived into the film’s racial politics.
You didn’t even need to be a pop-culture figure to get chewed up by these wild swerves of prevailing opinion. For reasons that remain hard to discern, a sweater-wearing man named Ken Bone became an internet hero after asking a question during a 2016 presidential debate — but after hearing of his past Reddit posts about pornography and the “justified” shooting of Trayvon Martin, millions of people turned instantly from applauding this total stranger to mocking and denouncing him. In an age of hyperpublic living, every person, company and brand is one tripwire away from a precipitous fall and a furious backlash.
No matter how familiar the internet becomes with how all this works, even seemingly manageable events will send the usual cycles repeating, each more exaggerated than the last. It’s predictable that, after the death of a political figure, solemn eulogies will give way to vigorous criticism, which will in turn occasion righteous defenses. But you still might not have guessed that, within 36 hours after the death of Barbara Bush, the Women’s March would be facing backlash for having tweeted “Rest in peace and power,” and a college professor would be facing nationwide calls for her firing over tweets that called Bush racist and expressed pleasure in her death — each impulse, it seems, working hard to counter the prevalence of the other.
“Backlash” entered the political lexicon around the mid-1950s, as a name for the powerful hostility with which many voters reacted to the nascent civil rights movement. By the 1964 presidential race, the British journalist Godfrey Hodgson was writing of a “white backlash” driving the campaign of the segregationist Democrat George Wallace. That same year, the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset published an article titled “Beyond the Backlash,” arguing that extremist conservative revolts, including the K.K.K. and McCarthyism, were a recurring feature in American politics, arising whenever powerful groups viewed themselves as in decline. And in the decades since, the entire concept of political backlash has been deeply connected with reactionary uprisings among certain white conservatives — a streak of resentment the Republican Party has quite often turned to its electoral advantage. “From George Wallace to George W. Bush,” the writer Thomas Frank observed in 2005, “a class-based backlash against the perceived arrogance of liberalism” has been one of the most powerful weapons in politics.
At the root of this analysis, of course, is the assumption that liberalism has been on a steady, triumphant march — that a progressive ascendance sparks a conservative reaction. (“It cannot be stressed too strongly,” Lipset wrote, that backlash politics were “a consequence of the fact that the United States is becoming more liberal.”) But in 2016, it was the avatar of white conservative resentment who was elected president — a result the CNN commentator Van Jones described, on election night, as a “whitelash.” And in the aftermath of this stark shift in government, it’s clearly difficult for Americans to reach even a vague consensus on which ideological impulses are dominant and which are lashing out in response. Many conservatives appear to have scarcely registered their political victories, preferring instead to complain of a sinister “deep state” beyond executive control and resume their retaliatory campaigns against Hillary Clinton. At the same time, the backlash strategy has been handed off like a baton, cropping up with greater frequency in descriptions of liberals energized by their opposition to Trump.
This is the landscape of our broader political wars. What’s fascinating is that it’s also the landscape of our innocuous pop-culture battles, over which films are underrated and which celebrities overappreciated. Social media, in particular, is almost perfectly designed to turn mundane exchanges into ferocious moral dust-ups. Questions of taste and aesthetics have always been intimately bound up with questions of status and character and overarching cultural values. Even the most humdrum disagreement resolves itself, through one wave of backlash after another, into the same central question: Why does “everyone” believe the wrong thing?
