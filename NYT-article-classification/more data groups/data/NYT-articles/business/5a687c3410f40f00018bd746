The Presidents Club dinner was a little-known charity event held at the posh Dorchester Hotel until yesterday, when the FT published a scathing investigation into the all-male-attendee event. What the news outlet discovered from its undercover reporting was what it described as a bacchanalia filled with drinking — and the groping of women hostesses.
From the article by Madison Marriage, who said she, while working undercover, had been harassed:
Here’s what Anne Milton, an education minister, said of the event in a session of Parliament today:
The responses 
• The Presidents Club said that it would not host any more events.
• WPP, which had bought a table at the event over the years, said early today that it had ended its association with the event.
• An organizer of the event, the businessman David Meller, has stepped down from a nonexecutive chairman position at the Department of Education.
• British lawmakers demanded that companies that had attended the event publish their employee gender ratios quickly.
• The Bank of England said that Mark Carney would not follow through on a lunch that was auctioned off at the dinner.
• Reporters began looking into the charity’s public financial reports, and were left unimpressed:
• Britain’s charity overseer has begun an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment.

Here at Davos, people are buzzing about businesses’ need to do good for society. (There’s an Equality Lounge on site at the World Economic Forum, and attendees are still talking about BlackRock’s new initiative.) And the singer Usher is here for a celebration of what would have been Nelson Mandela’s 100th birthday.
Travis Kalanick is at the World Economic Forum. He doesn’t have an official attendee badge, but he made the rounds at dinners and parties last night.
Of course, officially invited is Uber’s current C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi, who was on a panel discussion that Andrew moderated yesterday. (Mr. Khosrowshahi told CNBC that his relationship with his predecessor was “fine, but strained.”)
Where it got awkward: Both men attended a dinner hosted by Jack Ma of Alibaba, according to our spies. They sat on opposite ends of the table.

The slide in the American dollar gained momentum Wednesday after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a weaker dollar was good for the United States.
Robert Rubin, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton Administration, was sharply critical of Mr. Mnuchin’s comments.
“I’ve always felt that our self interest was in having a strong dollar,” Mr. Rubin said in an interview in his office at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is chairman emeritus.
The best way for United States companies to compete globally, Mr. Rubin said, is for them to be “productive, efficient, and effective.” And the best way for the government to help them do that, he said, is through investments in education, infrastructure and other programs that improve the country’s long-term competitiveness.
“Promote our ability to export by our investments in our economy,” Mr. Rubin said, “not by weakening our terms of trade.”
Abandoning the United States’ longstanding strong-dollar policy, Mr. Rubin said, would carry risks to both the United States economy and the global financial system.
“A loss of confidence in our currency could also undermine our interest rate markets and our equities markets,” he said. A strong-dollar policy, by contrast, will “maintain the confidence of the world in our currency and our economy.”

The Democratic Party once embraced Silicon Valley. But with questions arising about the power of companies like Google and Facebook — as well as the role they played in Russia’s interference with the 2016 election — politicians and activists alike are calling for tighter scrutiny and regulation.

What happened: As Mr. Levin grew in stature, he began to press for more responsibility and money, irritating his mentor, the newspaper reported.

The bigger picture
From Jim Tankersley of the NYT:
The Japanese giant’s Vision Fund has led an $865 million investment in Katerra, a three-year-old construction firm. It’s the latest big bet by SoftBank.
Katerra — founded by the former Flextronics C.E.O. Michael Marks, the Silver Lake co-founder Jim Davidson and the real estate investor Fritz Wolff — is essentially a one-stop shop for offices and apartment buildings, from architectural design through actual construction.
The bigger picture: Katerra wants to go public eventually, Mr. Marks, told Michael. “Over time, we expect that we might get offers — but this is intended to stay an independent company,” he said. “This will be a public company at some point.”
