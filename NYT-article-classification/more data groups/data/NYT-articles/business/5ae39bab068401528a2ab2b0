US economic growth slowed to 2.3 percent pace in Q1
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy slowed to a moderate 2.3 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter as consumer spending turned in the weakest performance in nearly five years. Still, the January-March increase came in better than expected, supporting hopes for a solid rebound for the rest of the year. The Commerce Department reports that the gain in the gross domestic product, the economy's total output of goods and services, followed a 2.9 percent rise in the fourth quarter.

Sleep mode? Tech giants' kids' 'fixes' amount to baby steps
NEW YORK (AP) — Tech companies are making changes to services aimed at kids as critics question whether they should be targeting kids at all. Rather than kill the services completely, as some critics want, Facebook, Amazon and Google are mostly tinkering at the edges. Facebook, for instance, is merely letting parents limit when their kids can use Messenger Kids. That leaves open the underlying questions of whether the products are good for kids to begin with.

Theater subscription service MoviePass tightens plans

The move comes as the sustainability of MoviePass' business model comes into question. Because MoviePass is paying most theaters the full price of the ticket, the service loses money with just one or two movies in a month. MoviePass regularly changes its promotions and rates, and it's not clear whether the one-movie-a-day deal will return.

Money from pot taxes doesn't fix Colorado teachers' problems
DENVER (AP) — Colorado teachers are protesting to call for higher salaries and increased funding for schools, prompting questions about why the state's booming legal marijuana sales have not fixed the problems. The 2012 voter-approved constitutional amendment permitting marijuana sales to adults got a boost from a commitment to send millions of dollars to Colorado schools. But those taxes are a small share of the multibillion-dollar education budget.
