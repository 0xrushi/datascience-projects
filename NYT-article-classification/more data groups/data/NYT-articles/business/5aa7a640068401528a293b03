President Trump has stepped in to protect Qualcomm from Broadcom, a foreign company that wanted to buy the San Diego-based chip maker. Rather than let market forces decide what should happen in the chip industry, the administration intervened because it had concerns about national security. One of the government's main worries, laid out in a March 5 letter, was that Broadcom would reduce Qualcomm’s spending on research and development, causing Qualcomm to lose ground in the race to develop important new technologies like 5G, which is designed to make wireless networks faster and more reliable. Chinese companies may gain an advantage in 5G, for instance.
Qualcomm does spend a lot on research and development. In its last fiscal year, the company’s $5.5 billion of research and development outlays were equivalent to 25 percent of its revenue. That was up from 21 percent on average in the preceding five years. According to Qualcomm executives, spending on 5G has driven the increase.
The big question is what Qualcomm does now. Will the company become less efficient under the government’s protection? Will it be tempted to spend less on research and development? If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.

The Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.
On Monday, President Trump blocked Broadcom’s hostile bid for Qualcomm. The move came just over three months after President Trump’s Justice Department drew plenty of attention for suing to block AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner.
That’s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions.
But the administration’s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers.
Here’s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government:
• In March, Changnong, a unit of Beijing Dabeinong Technology, scrapped plans to buy Waldo Farms after it failed to obtain United States government approval.
• In September, the Trump administration blocks China’s Canyon Bridge Capital Partners’ $1.3 billion bid for Lattice Semiconductor over national security concerns.
• In November, Cowen Group called off its deal for CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, to take a 20 percent stake in the New York boutique investment bank, blaming delays and “uncertainty” in securing Cfius approval.
• In January, MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, canceled their $1.2 billion deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies.
This approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views:
A decade ago, Bear Stearns was facing a grave liquidity crisis. Its stock had plummeted more than 20 percent in just days. Investors, as well as clients and broker-dealers, had pulled back from the firm, fearing that their continued exposure to plunging real estate assets threatened their solvency.
Amid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman’s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns:
The call left Sam Molinaro, Bear’s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. “When Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,” Mr. Molinaro said.
Of course, within days, JPMorgan, with the backing of the Federal Reserve, had stepped in and agreed to acquire Bear for $2 a share.
Mr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday.
When President Trump signed the sweeping tax overhaul into law late last year, he said, “Corporations are literally going wild over this.” We’re not ones to judge whether that’s an overstatement, but a new study has found that, at the least, many plan on going shopping.
Here’s what a survey of 500 American companies with sales of at least $500 million by EY found:
• 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions
• 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case
• 69 percent of respondents say that they’re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax code
The responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.
“At the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,” Bill Casey, EY’s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies’ deal-making spirits.
Not that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.
But for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.
“There’s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,” Mr. Casey said.
Other findings from the survey
• 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way
• 89 percent said that they planned to “enhance compensation” because of forthcoming tax benefits
• 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps
• 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers

Few deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.
President Trump essentially salted the earth for Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom was ordered to “immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover,” and its nominees for Qualcomm’s board, who had stood a good chance of winning most of the seats, were immediately disqualified.
What John Kabealo, a specialist in foreign investment law, told Cecilia Kang and Alan Rappeport of the NYT:
Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic & International Studies told Bloomberg, “This decision hangs a huge ‘not-for-sale’ sign on just about every American semiconductor firm.”
Big question 1: Much has been made of this White House’s protectionism. But Cfius, the government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, cited Broadcom’s “relationships with third-party foreign entities.” What does that mean?
Big question 2: Did Broadcom — which sped up its efforts to move its legal headquarters to the U.S. in apparent defiance of Cfius’s orders — misplay this situation?
Big question 3: Does any non-U.S. bidder for an American company now need to worry about Cfius?
Critics’ corner:  Brook Sutherland of Gadfly warns, “This should be a warning for future deal makers and would-be friends of Trump.” Considering Qualcomm’s prospects now, Lex says the company “has disappointed before — even without the president’s help.”
Market reaction
Shares of Qualcomm are down 4.5 percent, while Broadcom’s stock rose 1.7 percent. Rival chip maker Intel, which has been considering a number alternatives in response Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, gained 2.7 percent.
Andrew took the wraps off the Alphabet C.E.O.’s well-hidden side project, which aims to be the Uber of self-flying aircraft before Uber can even get there.

New Zealand has long been seen as safety-conscious, so its regulations for the vehicles could be a model in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Now that the Wall Street titan has officially anointed an up-and-coming disc jockey — a.k.a. David Solomon, longtime investment banker — Lloyd Blankfein’s likely successor, it’s worth considering his priorities:
From Dakin Campbell of Bloomberg:
And in an interview with the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson last month, Mr. Solomon suggested that Goldman — which has added consumer lending to its stable of services — “could move in your direction a little bit.”
The succession race was Wall Street’s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz.
From Kate Kelly of the NYT:
Peter Eavis’s take: Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading into more stable businesses like wealth management.
A stumble for Goldman’s deal business: It’s fifth in Thomson Reuters’s global league tables, behind Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard.
As the current front-runner to replace Gary Cohn, the CNBC commentator would become the White House’s top salesman for its economic policies — and one of the top internal supporters of free trade, when protectionism is ascendant.
Why Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT:
Just in time: Mr. Kudlow and Stephen Moore have an op-ed in today’s WSJ on the economy. From the piece: “Mr. Trump’s tax-cutting and deregulatory policies are already pushing out the supply curve, creating real growth that isn’t inflationary.”
More context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.

Also of note: Apple’s market value as of yesterday’s close was $922 billion, after touching a high of $925 billion.
The virtual currency corner: Bitcoin is at $9,189.66 this morning. Endowments and foundations are steering clear of virtual currencies, but that doesn’t mean they’re not interested.
