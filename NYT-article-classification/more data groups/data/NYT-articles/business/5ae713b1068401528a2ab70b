T-Mobile-Sprint Deal Makes Business Sense, German Finance Minister Says
BERLIN â€” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Monday that the planned takeover of Sprint Corp by Deutsche Telekom's U.S. unit T-Mobile US made sense from a business perspective.
Scholz also said: "I welcome the clear statement from Deutsche Telekom that the transaction will not have any impact on its broadband roll-out in Germany and that planned investment of 5 billion euros per year will be carried out without cutbacks."
Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges expressed confidence on Monday that the $26 billion takeover would clear anti-trust hurdles.
