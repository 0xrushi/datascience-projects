8 Classical Music Concerts to See in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
CALIDORE STRING QUARTET at Alice Tully Hall (April 13, 7:30 p.m.). One of the innumerable quality quartets doing the rounds at the moment, this group takes on a fairly routine but nonetheless interesting program of Mendelssohn, Shostakovich and Beethoven.212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org
‘CANDIDE’ at Carnegie Hall (April 18, 7 p.m.). The celebrations of Leonard Bernstein’s 100th birthday continue with this concert version of his take on Voltaire, played by the Orchestra of St. Luke’s. Paul Appleby is in the title role, with Patricia Racette as the Old Lady, Erin Morley as Cunegonde, William Burden as the Governor and John Lithgow as Voltaire/Dr. Pangloss.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
DEL SOL STRING QUARTET at Miller Theater (April 19, 8 p.m.). When one thinks of Frederic Rzewski, it’s hard to go much beyond “The People United Will Never Be Defeated,” his immense set of political variations for solo piano, but, of course, much worthwhile music can be explored elsewhere. Here, there’s the String Quartet from 1955 and the premiere of a new quartet, “Words.”212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
RICHARD GOODE at Alice Tully Hall (April 17, 7:30 p.m.). The distinguished pianist performs a mix of the expected and the surprising on this program, with Bach’s English Suite No. 6 and Beethoven’s Op. 101 Piano Sonata on the one hand, and music by Byrd and Debussy on the other.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers
JUILLIARD ORCHESTRA at David Geffen Hall (April 16, 7:30 p.m.). My colleague Zachary Woolfe recently wrote that in a time when we ought to rethink our very idea of what a conductor could and should be, Alan Gilbert’s tenure at the New York Philharmonic was “more of a model than I recognized.” Perhaps so, though I still have more doubts about the caliber of the performances he put in. Either way, here’s a chance to listen again, hard, as Mr. Gilbert conducts the young players of the Juilliard Orchestra in Barber’s Essay No. 1, Rouse’s Flute Concerto (with the soloist Giorgio Consolati) and Brahms’s Symphony No. 1.212-799-5000, juilliard.edu
MATA FESTIVAL at the Kitchen (April 13, 8 p.m.). A greatest hits parade of some of the most important music to come out of this crucial festival in its first 20 years, including Randy Hostetler’s “P(l)aces,” Carlos Gutierrez Quiroga’s “Jintili,” Kate Moore’s “Sensitive Spot” and Eric Wubbels’s “Viola Quartet (IJVER).”matafestival.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (April 19, 7:30 p.m., through April 24). Mozart and Bruckner are on the bill this week, with Till Fellner playing the Piano Concerto No. 22 and Christoph Eschenbach conducting it, and Bruckner’s frightening, unfinished Symphony No. 9.212-875-5656, nyphil.org
MARK PADMORE AND PAUL LEWIS at Alice Tully Hall (April 19, 7:30 p.m.). At least among partnerships in which the pianist is a recognized soloist in his own right, I can think of no finer duo in lieder than this. Unusually, here there is not a bar of Schubert in sight. There is plenty of Schumann, however, with the “Liederkreis” and the “Dichterliebe,” as well as songs by Brahms.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers
