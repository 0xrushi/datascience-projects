7 Classical Music Concerts to See in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ANN CLEARE at the Miller Theater (March 1, 8 p.m.). Hailing from Ireland, this young composer was trained at Harvard and Ircam, and receives a prestigious composer portrait here with the best of advocates on hand, the International Contemporary Ensemble. Led by Steven Schick, they play “Teeth of Light, Tongue of Waves,” which is a premiere, and three other works.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
DANISH STRING QUARTET at Alice Tully Hall (Feb. 25, 5 p.m.). This foursome of three Danes and a Norwegian is one of our most energetic and effervescent young quartets — beards, line of craft beer and all. They stick to the Austro-Germanic tradition in this performance, but with a neat trick in the first half: three quartets dealing with the subject of hunts, by Haydn, Mozart and Jörg Widmann. There’s Brahms, too.212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org
‘ELEKTRA’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 1, 8 p.m., through March 23). There has been no more electric night at Carnegie Hall in recent years than the one that witnessed Christine Goerke’s Elektra with the Boston Symphony in 2015, and here, finally, is a chance to see her sing the role onstage. In Patrice Chéreau’s devastating production, Ms. Goerke is joined by Elza van der Heever as Chrysothemis, Michaela Schuster as Klytämnestra and Mikhail Petrenko as Orest. Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the future music director, is on the podium.212-362-6000, metopera.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 28, 7:30 p.m., through March 3). Another program from the music director designate Jaap van Zweden, and a rather simple one. Yuja Wang is the soloist for the tumultuous Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1; after that comes Prokofiev’s Symphony No. 5.212-875-5656, nyphil.org
MITSUKO UCHIDA at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 26, 8 p.m.). Whenever I want to listen to Schubert’s piano sonatas, more likely than not I will turn to Mitsuko Uchida’s recordings. She plays this music with such poise, with such glow, but never stints on its dark, psychological side. This concert, as well as a second on March 2, begins a two-season survey at Carnegie, setting off with the harrowing C minor, D. 958, the earlier D. 664 in A, and the grander D. 894 in G.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
VIENNA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 23-24, 8 p.m.; Feb. 25, 2 p.m.). Gustavo Dudamel, the conductor whose widely heralded success in Los Angeles has sat awkwardly alongside persistent questions about his stance on political issues in his native Venezuela, is the chosen leader of this orchestra’s annual trip to New York. For the most part, the programs are staid. On Friday, there is an all-Brahms program; on Saturday, Mahler and Berlioz. On Sunday, there’s Tchaikovsky’s Fourth and, quite surprisingly, Ives’s Second — what on earth these urbane Viennese will make of that raucous piece of Americana is probably worth investigating.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
