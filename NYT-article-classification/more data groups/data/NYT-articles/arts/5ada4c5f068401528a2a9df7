Pop’s Category Killers, From Live Nation to Spotify, Under the Microscope
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
In recent weeks, the big businesses that present music to the public have undergone some tectonic ripples and shifts. On April 3, Spotify went public, offering shares on the New York Stock Exchange via a direct offering. (The shares sold were all previously held by investors — no new shares were made available.)
A couple of days before that, The New York Times reported that the Department of Justice was making inquiries into possible anti-competitive behavior by Live Nation in the years since its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster.
To discuss how the latest developments with these large corporations are shaping the music industry for artists and also consumers, Mr. Caramanica was joined on this week’s Popcast by Ben Sisario, the music business reporter for the Times, who has covered both stories extensively.
