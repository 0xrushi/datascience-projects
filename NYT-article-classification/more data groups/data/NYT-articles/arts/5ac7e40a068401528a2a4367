Logic, XXXTentacion and Hip-Hop Morality in 2018
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
Last month, the earnest rapper Logic released “Bobby Tarantino II,” which made its debut at the top of the Billboard album chart. It was the culmination of a determined climb from backpack-rap obscurity to pop-rap ubiquity, and perhaps early notice of an imminent realignment of rap’s power structure.
Its reign was short, though. After just one week, it was knocked out of the top spot by a rapper working the polar opposite of the moral spectrum: XXXTentacion, the most versatile artist of the SoundCloud rap generation, and also the one with the most heinous allegations of criminal behavior.
These two artists are both successes of modern internet-driven fandom. And even though their musical and thematic approaches are very different, they have things in common that might not be evident from a surface read, in terms of the emotional language they deploy and the way they connect with young hip-hop fans.
To discuss these artists, and how they relate to examples of male frailty in earlier generations of pop music, Mr. Caramanica is joined on this week’s Popcast by Lindsay Zoladz, a staff writer at the Ringer and former pop music critic for New York magazine.
