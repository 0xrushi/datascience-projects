Cardi B Arrives at the Top
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
In the last seven days, Cardi B released her major-label debut album, “Invasion of Privacy,” co-hosted “The Tonight Show” alongside Jimmy Fallon; and appeared on “Saturday Night Live,” using a performance of her new song “Be Careful” to announce her pregnancy.
It has been, by any measurement, a broad-scale takeover for the 25-year-old who came to rap after making herself a star, first on social media, then on reality TV. And it reflects both widespread enthusiasm for Cardi B and her music, and also her willingness to meet the moment with energy.
This two-way exchange has been instrumental to her success over the past few years, and on this week’s Cardi B round-table Popcast Mr. Caramanica discusses it with Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, deputy editor of Jezebel; Naomi Zeichner, a writer and a former editor in chief of The Fader; Caryn Ganz, the Times’s pop music editor and Joe Coscarelli, the Times’s pop music reporter.
