The Caramoor Festival Takes a Contemporary Turn
Change is in the air at Caramoor, the summer music festival in Westchester, which said on Monday that its coming season would move both forward and backward in time — giving new prominence to 21st-century composers while replacing its respected bel canto opera offerings with earlier operas from the Classical and Baroque periods.
This summer’s offerings will feature music by 22 living composers; the Caramoor debuts of new music ensembles including the Kronos Quartet and So Percussion; and a free outdoor performance of John Luther Adams’s “Inuksuit.” It is the first Caramoor summer programmed by Kathy Schuman, the festival’s new vice president for artistic programming and a former artistic administrator at Carnegie Hall.
“While we always love to welcome back favorites, I want to make sure we’re staying current and keeping up with today’s most exciting musicians and composers,” she said in a statement.
The operatic landscape is shifting at the festival, which is held on a former estate in Katonah, N.Y. The festival ended its Bel Canto at Caramoor program last summer after 20 years; the organizer of that series, Will Crutchfield, is reinventing it as Teatro Nuovo at Purchase College, part of the State University of New York.
This summer Caramoor will present operas from earlier periods. A concert performances of Handel’s “Atalanta” will feature Nicholas McGegan conducting the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra of San Francisco. And Mozart’s “La Finta Giardiniera” will be performed by On Site Opera, a New York company that specializes in site-specific performances, in the estate’s Sunken Garden.
The Orchestra of St. Luke’s will open the festival on June 16 with a concert featuring Audra McDonald, and close it on July 29 with Bernard Labadie, its principal conductor designate, leading the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham in Handel and Mozart.
