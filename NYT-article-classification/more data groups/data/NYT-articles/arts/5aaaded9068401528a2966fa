8 Classical Music Concerts to See in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ACADEMY OF ST. MARTIN IN THE FIELDS at David Geffen Hall (March 19, 8 p.m.). Joshua Bell brings the famed London chamber orchestra to Lincoln Center, leading it from the concertmaster’s chair and acting as the soloist in Wieniawski’s Violin Concerto No. 2. Mendelssohn’s overture to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6, the “Pastoral,” make up the rest of the program.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers
ALARM WILL SOUND at Zankel Hall (March 16, 7:30 p.m.). Billed as a “live podcast,” this concert from a particularly adventurous contemporary-music ensemble dives into the works of Gyorgy Ligeti, including his Piano Concerto, Chamber Concerto and “Continuum.” Alan Pierson, the conductor, hosts with Nadia Sirota, introducing the music and offering insight into the composer’s life and times.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
APOLLO’S FIRE at Zankel Hall (March 22, 7:30 p.m.). Imagine yourself taking a seat at Leipzig’s Café Zimmermann in this homage to the coffee houses that were so important to musical development in 18th-century Europe. Jeannette Sorrell directs Cleveland’s leading period-instrument ensemble in music by Telemann, Vivaldi, Handel and Bach, including two of the “Brandenburg” Concertos.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
HEATH QUARTET at the David Rubinstein Atrium (March 22, 7:30 p.m.). If it’s slightly odd that this very accomplished quartet — notable for several recent recordings on Harmonia Mundi — is not playing in one of Lincoln Center’s more formal spaces, at least you can hear them for free at this concert. Haydn and Tchaikovsky provide the fare.212-721-6500, lincolncenter.org/great-performers
ANGELA HEWITT at the 92nd Street Y (March 18, 3 p.m.). The sixth installment of Ms. Hewitt’s Bach Odyssey comprises a single work, one that she has recorded twice to outstanding effect: the “Goldberg” Variations.212-415-5500, 92y.org
JUILLIARD415 at Miller Theater (March 20, 6 p.m.). The students of the Juilliard School’s period-instrument group venture uptown for this intimate, free pop-up concert. The repertoire is unusual chamber music by Leclair, Boismortier, Porpora and Handel.212-854-7799, millertheatre.com
‘LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 22, 7:30 p.m., through May 10). Mary Zimmerman’s 2007 production of Donizetti’s tragedy returns, in the first of several permutations of the cast. Olga Peretyatko-Mariotti is the first Lucia (Jessica Pratt and Pretty Yende follow later in the run), with Vittorio Grigolo performing as the first Edgardo (Michael Fabiano appears opposite Ms. Yende toward the end of April). Massimo Cavalletti as Enrico and Vitalij Kowaljow as Raimondo round out the cast, and Roberto Abbado is on the podium.212-362-6000, metopera.org
NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY at Carnegie Hall (March 18, 2 p.m.). Always lively in performance, this youth orchestra should be admired for its commitment to new music. Thomas Kotcheff’s “Go And” receives its premiere at this matinee, and Demarre McGill joins the group as the soloist for Kevin Puts’s Flute Concerto. Also on the bill are Rimsky-Korsakov’s “Capriccio espagnol” and Dvorak’s Symphony No. 8. Michael Repper conducts.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
