Ashlee Simpson: You Asked, We Answered
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
Last week, the Popcast battled the historical record in defense of Ashlee Simpson — the younger sister of Jessica, an early pop-punk and scene kid and an edgier pop product than Hilary Duff. Ms. Simpson was a platinum-selling star who burned bright and fast, and has largely been consigned to pop music history’s dustbins.
This week, on part two, The New York Times Ashlee Simpson fan club — Mr. Caramanica, the pop music editor Caryn Ganz and the pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli — returns to continue the Simpson excavation and defense.
First comes an in-depth look at her MTV reality show, “The Ashlee Simpson Show.” That’s followed by an extensive listener mailbag, covering a wide range of topics, including Ms. Simpson’s relationship to the melodic hardcore of the mid-2000s, a comparison between her “Saturday Night Live” performance nightmare and that of Lana Del Rey a decade later and the Simpson family’s appeal to evangelicals.
