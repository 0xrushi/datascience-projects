Lincoln Center’s Next Season: Salonen, Pittsburgh, ‘The Creation’
Esa-Pekka Salonen will conduct the Philharmonia Orchestra of London in performances of Bruckner and his own cello concerto. Manfred Honeck will lead the Pittsburgh Symphony in Mahler and Beethoven. And William Christie and Les Arts Florissants will leave their usual Baroque era behind and try their hands at the Classical style with a performance of Haydn’s oratorio “The Creation.”
Those are some of the highlights of next season’s Great Performers series at Lincoln Center, which was announced Tuesday and will run from October through May.
The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center said that it would focus on Russian music next season, including a special winter festival and a performance by the Borodin Quartet. Its season will also feature the Escher String Quartet playing a new work by Andrew Norman and two programs celebrating the composer George Crumb, who turns 90 in October 2019. The society said that its popular summer evening series would return to Alice Tully Hall for three evenings this July.
The twin announcements gave further shape to what the 2018-19 season will look like around Lincoln Center.
The Chamber Music Society will present the Calidore String Quartet, the Emerson String Quartet, the violinist Daniel Hope and the pianist Inon Barnatan. Lincoln Center’s Great Performers series includes Hilary Hahn playing Bach, the composer with which she made her name; the early-music group Accademia Bizantina; and some memorable chamber music of its own, including the Takacs Quartet and a starry trio featuring the violinist Joshua Bell, the pianist Jeremy Denk and the cellist Steven Isserlis.
Here is the Pittsburgh Symphony playing Mahler’s Symphony No. 5, which will close the Great Performers season on May 19, 2019:
