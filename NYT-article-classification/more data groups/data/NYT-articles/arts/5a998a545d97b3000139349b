Lucy Dacus, Soccer Mommy, the Breeders and the Future of Indie Rock
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
Three indie-rock albums arrive on Friday: the Virginia singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus is releasing her second LP, “Historian”; Soccer Mommy, the recording alias of Sophie Allison, is releasing her first studio record, “Clean”; and the Breeders, one of the essential bands of early 1990s alternative rock, are releasing “All Nerve,” their first album in 25 years with their “Last Splash” lineup.
This week’s Popcast covers them all. Mr. Caramanica talks about Ms. Dacus with Joe Coscarelli, the Times’s pop music reporter, who checked in with her regularly over the last year as she was recording “Historian” and emerging from obscurity into an indie-rock star in the making. Ms. Dacus has developed a kinship with Julien Baker, another female singer-songwriter who is deeply thoughtful about how her music is received, who the Times’s chief pop music critic, Jon Pareles, profiled last year.
Mr. Caramanica and Mr. Pareles also discuss Soccer Mommy’s LP, which comes after a string of self-released albums and which Mr. Pareles writes “greatly expands the scope of Ms. Allison’s songs in both words and music.” Soccer Mommy is currently touring with Phoebe Bridgers, another powerful singer-songwriter and obvious kin to Ms. Dacus.
And the Times’s pop music editor Caryn Ganz discusses the Breeders then and now, as well as similarities between the current female indie-rock generation and that of the early 1990s.
