Kacey Musgraves and Ashley McBryde, Country Traditionalists With a Twist
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
Country music continues to have an agonized relationship with female performers, and plenty of the most thoughtful women in the genre continue to respond with strong music that mostly ignores the roles Nashville lays out for them.
This week, this tension is captured in a pair of new albums: “Golden Hour,” the third major label album by Kacey Musgraves, and “Girl Going Nowhere,” the major label debut of Ashley McBryde. Ms. Musgraves has been toying with country music orthodoxy for the last few years, and she has begun moving that experimentation from her songwriting to the production of her songs. Ms. McBryde focuses on crisp songwriting and a wide-tent approach to influences, taking in blues and Southern rock.
To discuss these albums on this week’s Popcast, Mr. Caramanica was joined by Natalie Weiner, a music and sports journalist who is a staff writer at Bleacher Report and who recently profiled Ms. Musgraves for the cover of Billboard.
