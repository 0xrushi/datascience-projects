6 Classical Music Concerts to See in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
TIMO ANDRES at Bargemusic (March 9, 8 p.m.). The composer and pianist gives a solo recital showcasing his own music — “How Can I Live in Your World of Ideas?” — and that of three of his peers, Caroline Shaw, Christopher Cerrone and Eric Shanfield. Also on the bill is a selection of movements from Janacek’s “On an Overgrown Path.”800-838-3006, bargemusic.org
‘CELLULAR SONGS’ at BAM Harvey Theater (March 14-17, 7:30 p.m., through March 18). A new work by Meredith Monk, still an essential artist after all these years, has its premiere. It is inspired by biological processes — mutation, division — and is performed by Ms. Monk and four singers from her ensemble.718-636-4100, bam.org
‘COSÌ FAN TUTTE’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 15, 7:30 p.m., through April 19). Phelim McDermott’s new production of Mozart’s dark comedy emphasizes its fantasy and its playfulness, setting it in a 1950s Coney Island-style fairground. David Robertson conducts a cast most notable for the Despina of Kelli O’Hara, the Broadway star, as well as Amanda Majeski (Fiordiligi), Serena Malfi (Dorabella), Ben Bliss (Ferrando), Adam Plachetka (Guglielmo) and Christopher Maltman (Don Alfonso).212-362-6000, metopera.org
ANGELA HEWITT at the 92nd Street Y (March 14, 7:30 p.m.). Nobody plays Bach quite like Angela Hewitt, whose career has concentrated on the composer above all others. Her “Bach Odyssey” continues, in its second season of four, with a performance of the complete first book of “The Well-Tempered Clavier.”212-415-5500, 92y.org
PHILADELPHIA ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (March 13, 8 p.m.). The last concert in Janine Jansen’s Perspectives series coincides with a rare outing for this venerable orchestra in contemporary music, as together they play Michel van der Aa’s Violin Concerto, written for the soloist in 2014. As if he were not busy enough at the moment, Yannick Nézet-Séguin also conducts Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 2.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
QUATUOR ÉBÈNE at Zankel Hall (March 13, 7:30 p.m.). The pre-eminent French foursome returns to New York with Fauré’s only string quartet, Dutilleux’s “Ainsi la nuit” and the second of Beethoven’s “Razumovsky” quartets.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
