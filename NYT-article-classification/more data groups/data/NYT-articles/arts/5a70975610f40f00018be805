Can the Grammys Be Fixed?
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
At the 60th annual Grammy Awards Sunday night, Bruno Mars swept the major categories, Kendrick Lamar dominated the rap categories, and Jay-Z, the most nominated artist, was shut out. Lorde sat in the audience clutching a flask — she was reportedly not invited to perform her own material at the event — and the next day, subtweeted the Recording Academy. Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber and Drake didn’t bother showing up.
This hodgepodge reflects the confused state of the Grammys, which still struggles with race and gender: Only one woman won in a major category Sunday night, and the sort of hip-hop that’s been a fixture at the top of the Billboard charts was essentially absent from both the nominations and the performances.
For a spirited recap about the strengths and weaknesses of this year’s Grammys, Mr. Caramanica was joined by the whole pop music team of The New York Times: the chief pop music critic Jon Pareles, the pop music editor Caryn Ganz, the pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli and the music business reporter Ben Sisario.
