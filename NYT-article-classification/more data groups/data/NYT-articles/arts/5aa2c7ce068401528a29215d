Was Ashlee Simpson Underappreciated? Discuss
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
In pop music, there are oodles of heroes, and also more than a few misunderstood giants. From time to time on Popcast, we attempt to correct the historical record and give maligned artists their proper due.
Which is to say: As long promised, the Popcast presents the Ashlee Simpson edition, part one.
Were you aware that Ms. Simpson’s debut album, “Autobiography,” went triple platinum? And that the follow-up, “I Am Me,” went platinum as well? Did you know that Ms. Simpson’s third album, “Bittersweet World,” was heavily produced by Timbaland? Did you know that Ms. Simpson even had a third album?
On this week’s Popcast, the Ashlee Simpson enthusiasts of The New York Times — Mr. Caramanica, the pop music editor Caryn Ganz and the pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli — gather for the first of two episodes devoted to Ms. Simpson’s career; this one focuses on her music, and the second will center on her television show and her run as a tabloid celebrity, and will also include a listener mailbag.
