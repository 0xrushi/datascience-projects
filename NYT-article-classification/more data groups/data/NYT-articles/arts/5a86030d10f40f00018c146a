8 Classical Music Concerts to See in NYC This Weekend
Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
ANNA CATERINA ANTONACCI at Zankel Hall (Feb. 20-21, 7:30 p.m.). Accompanied by Donald Sulzen, the leading soprano gives a rare, double recital at Carnegie, presented by the New York City Opera.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
EMANUEL AX, LEONIDAS KAVAKOS AND YO-YO MA at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 22, 8 p.m.). Trios do not come much starrier than this, and unlike many celebrity ensembles, this one has a real connection. Together, they play all three Brahms Piano Trios, a program that they have been presenting since 2015 and was released on a recording last year. If the performance sells out, which it probably will soon, try for returns.212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org
CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (Feb. 20, 7:30 p.m.). An unusually interesting program from the Chamber Music Society, comprising three quintets, which are all responses, in one way or another, to World War I. Ravel’s “Le tombeau de Couperin” is the best known, even when arranged for five winds; it comes with Dohnanyi’s Piano Quintet No. 2 and Elgar’s Piano Quintet, with its typically sublime slow movement.212-875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Feb. 22, 7:30 p.m., through Feb. 24). The Philharmonic’s assistant conductor, Joshua Gersen, leads as American a program as it is possible to think of, at least in one particular idea of what American music might be. Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” leads off, followed by the Symphonic Dances from Bernstein’s “West Side Story,” before Copland’s Symphony No. 3, with its rousing “Fanfare for the Common Man.”212-875-5656, nyphil.org
EMMANUEL PAHUD AND ALESSIO BAX at the 92nd Street Y (Feb. 17, 8 p.m.). Mr. Bax is a strong pianist in his own right, but Mr. Pahud is the real attraction here, perhaps the world’s most distinguished flutist, and the principal of the Berlin Philharmonic. Flute Sonatas by Bach and Poulenc come with transcriptions of Schubert’s “Arpeggione” Sonata and Mendelssohn’s F major Violin Sonata.212-415-5500, 92y.org
CHRISTOPH PRÉGARDIEN at the 92nd Street Y (Feb. 16, 9 p.m.). Long one of the most insightful interpreters of Schubert, this tenor sings “Winterreise,” accompanied by the pianist Julius Drake.212-415-5500, 92y.org
‘SEMIRAMIDE’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 19, 7:30 p.m., through March 17). Although controversy surrounds the firing of the Met’s director John Copley late last month, this revival of his 1990 production of Rossini’s bel canto feast goes ahead regardless, for the first time since 1993. Maurizio Benini conducts a cast that includes Angela Meade in the title role, Javier Camarena as Idreno, Ildar Abdrazakov as Assur, Elizabeth DeShong as Arsace and Ryan Speedo Green as Oroe.212-362-6000, metopera.org
TALEA ENSEMBLE at the Italian Academy (Feb. 21, 7:30 p.m.). In the pick of this week’s free concerts, Karen Kim is the violinist for “La lontananza nostalgica utopica futura,” a profound late work by Luigi Nono. David Adamcyk marshals the live electronics.212-854-2306, italianacademy.columbia.edu
