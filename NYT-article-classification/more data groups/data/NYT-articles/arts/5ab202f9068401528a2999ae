‘The Sound of Music,’ ‘Rumours’ and More Join the National Recording Registry
The Library of Congress on Wednesday announced its 25 annual additions to the National Recording Registry, honoring significant pieces of American history and culture. While some of the titles are instantly recognizable — the “Sound of Music” soundtrack, the Temptations’ “My Girl” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” album — others are more significant for their influence on future generations.
“How I Got Over,” for example, is credited to the gospel artist Clara Ward; her sister Willa says that Clara wrote the song after she was taunted with racial epithets on the way to a performance. Mavis Staples recently said that the Mahalia Jackson version of the song was the first she ever heard sung by a woman. Ms. Staples would later cover the song with the Staples Singers; Aretha Franklin and the Blind Boys of Alabama have also recorded it.
“Sitting on Top of the World” was recorded in 1930 by the Mississippi Sheiks. The malleable song would be performed in various styles, from folk to country to bluegrass: Cream, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and Jack White all have versions.
And Artur Schnabel’s recording of Beethoven’s 32 sonatas in 1932 was the first complete recording of that collection; it set a template for artists delving into complete surveys of master works, like Glenn Gould’s exhaustive foray into Bach which was recently released on a new box set.
The National Recording Registry now has 500 titles. Others added this year include Bill Haley & His Comets’ “Rock Around the Clock,” Tony Bennett’s “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” Gloria Estefan’s “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,” Run-DMC’s “Raising Hell” album and Canario y Su Grupo’s “Lamento Borincano,” about the plight of a Puerto Rican farmer.
