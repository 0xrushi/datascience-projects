“A congressman walks into a bar ...”
Alcohol — perhaps more than any product — has been a perennial target of regulation and a source of public revenue. It has inspired our government’s first tax, subsequent rebellions, consumer product regulations and unrestrained effort at eradicating it as an industry.
Join us for an event at Wigle Whiskey, Pittsburgh’s first distillery after Prohibition, to learn some of the historical highlights of the wild historical booze ride in the United States — and to examine what the future holds for drinking in Pennsylvania and across the country.
Clay Risen, a spirits expert and the deputy Op-Ed editor at The New York Times, will moderate the discussion with Meredith Meyer Grelli, a co-founder of Wigle Whiskey and Threadbare Cider and Mead; Leslie A. Przybylek, the senior curator at the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh; and Paul Costa, a Pennsylvania state representative and the Democratic chairman of the House Liquor Control Committee.
