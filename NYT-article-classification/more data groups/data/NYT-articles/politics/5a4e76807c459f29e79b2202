Is Identity Politics the New Tribalism?
To the Editor:
In “The Retreat to Tribalism” (column, Jan. 2), David Brooks critiques a new form of identity politics — one with “a tribal oppressor/oppressed story” — that he and others see as prevalent on college campuses.
He argues, “In societies like ours, individuals are responsible for their own identity, happiness and success.” Yet individuals live in cultures, where systematic discrimination — in schooling, housing, jobs and more — prevents many from happiness and success precisely as a result of their identities.
Since the late 19th century, young people, filled with idealism, have led movements for social change to stop wars, government corruption and especially discrimination. On my campus, students do not see themselves as victims; rather, they are activists for full inclusion for all.

To the Editor:
This new tribalism David Brooks speaks of is familiar in that it is driven by an evolutionary fear of difference — in race, ethnicity, culture, convention and social norms. But it is new in that transformative technology and globalization have reshuffled the deck of economic winners and losers. To many, this change is simply too much to absorb, and that has led to political extremism, intense partisanship and, often, to despair.
Fortunately, humanity has been blessed with a countervailing evolutionary trait: an empathic reflex to put ourselves in the other person’s shoes.
This interplay between tribalism and empathy is humanity’s story. Our challenge is to overcome our primordial human impulse of fear of “others” and embrace the empathy within each of us that insists we are all connected.
Conflicts diminish when we better understand the other side, and when we ourselves are better understood.
