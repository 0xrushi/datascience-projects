The Art Exhibitions to See in 2018
Travelers seeking inspiration for 2018 trips may want to consider art exhibitions and cultural festivals.
At the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., notable exhibitions include “Women House” (March 9 to May 28), which explores the role of women in American culture through photography, video, sculptures and large-scale installations, and “Heavy Metal — Women to Watch 2018” (June 28 to Sept. 16), a showcase of contemporary female artists who work with metal.
To see a different side of Picasso’s work, plan a trip to the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark. The exhibition “Picasso Ceramics” (Feb. 1 to May 27) includes 150 ceramics that reflect an experimental stage of the artist’s career as he worked with new materials and glazes to create a range of sculptural pieces.
Politics is the topic of a coming exhibition at SITE Santa Fe in New Mexico. In “Luke Dubois: A More Perfect Union” (Jan. 19 to April 4), democracy and elections are under the microscope. The most commonly used words in 43 State of the Union addresses are at the heart of a work called “Hindsight is Always 20.20.”
The desire to travel is the subject of a coming exhibition at the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin. “Wanderlust” (May 10 to Sept. 16) features works from a range of international artists, including Paul Gauguin, Caspar David Friedrich, Auguste Renoir and Gustave Courbet.
Cultural festivals also offer compelling reasons to plan a trip. At the Battle of the Oranges in Ivrea, Italy (Feb. 11 to 13), the main squares of the city are transformed into a colorful battleground for throwing oranges. The classical dances of India are the center of the Khajuraho Dance Festival (Feb. 25 to March 3), held in an open-air auditorium at the Khajuraho Group of Monuments in Madhya Pradesh, India.
