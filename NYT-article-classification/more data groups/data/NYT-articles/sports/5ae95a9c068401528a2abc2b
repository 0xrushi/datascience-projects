LEADING OFF: Mets Examine deGrom, Dodgers Try to Tag Corbin
A look at what's happening all around the majors Thursday:
CHECK UP
The Mets will see how pitcher Jacob deGrom is feeling, a day after he exited early because of a hyperextended right elbow. DeGrom threw four dominant innings against Atlanta before leaving, and has thrown 18 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings. The Mets have been beset by injuries to their pitching staff since reaching the 2015 World Series. ... Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera has missed three straight games because of a left biceps spasm and there's no timetable for his return.
YOU AGAIN?
Patrick Corbin struck out a career-high 12 when the Dodgers visited Arizona earlier this season, holding the NL champions to one hit over 7 1/3 scoreless innings. The 28-year-old lefty is 4-0 with a 2.25 ERA this season going into this start at home against Los Angeles.
WELCOME BACK
Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson is expected to join the team in Cleveland for a doubleheader. He's been on the disabled list since mid-April because of a shoulder problem. The 2015 AL MVP has played 12 games for Toronto this season, hitting three home runs with nine RBIs.
The Blue Jays are on the move this week. They played at Minnesota on Wednesday night, visit Cleveland for a twinbill caused by a couple of weather-related postponements, then begin a weekend series Friday night at Tampa Bay.
VICTORY LANE
White Sox righty Reynaldo Lopez hasn't given up more than two earned runs in any of his five starts this season, and sports a nifty 1.78 ERA. But Chicago hasn't supported him with the bats, leaving him with an 0-2 record. He'll try to get in the win column when he starts at home against Minnesota.
WAIT AND SEE
The Red Sox have put lefty Eduardo Rodriguez on the family medical leave list. Manager Alex Cora said he doesn't know if Rodriguez will miss his turn in the rotation.
